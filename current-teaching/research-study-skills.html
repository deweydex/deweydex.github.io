            <h2>Welcome to Research and Study Skills!</h2>
            <p>My name is Josh—together we will embark on an adventure in how we know what we know!</p>

            <p>If you have had a research and study skills class in the past, you might find that my interpretation is a bit different than your prior experiences.</p>

            <h3>What We Will (Broadly) Cover:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand how we know what we know: what research means and how we do it!</li>
                <li>Understand sources and how to use them</li>
                <li>Understand how laws and regulations relate to research and information that is "out there"</li>
                <li>Understand how to fool people with statistics (and maybe why lots of us don't like the S word)</li>
                <li>Understand different types of arguments and how they relate to sources</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How You Will Be Assessed This Year:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>40% Skills Demonstrations:</strong> in class</li>
                <li><strong>60% Portfolio/Collection of Work:</strong> in and outside of class with 1:1 feedback</li>
            </ul>

                <div class="detail-content">
                    <h4>Getting Started</h4>
                    <p>Please fill out the "Getting to Know You as a Human Being Form". Note, the more you type, the better I can understand your situation and tailor assignments and feedback to your specific background, circumstances and goals.</p>

                    <h4>Introductory Task</h4>
                    <p>On a new word doc please answer the following questions and go through the process below:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>What are three surprising or useful facts that you carry around with you? If you can't think of any how would you go about finding some? What sites or tools would you use?</li>
                        <li>Where did you learn these facts? If you wanted to verify them, how would you?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>Task:</strong> Try to verify the facts that you have specified. What are your sources, how do you know that that source is credible or "good"? Do you find any conflicting sources?</p>

                    <p><strong>Reflection (150-250 words):</strong> After you have answered those questions, please write a reflection on what was easy or difficult about these questions and this task: what was unexpected? How did you verify your source? If you had to challenge or critique how you went about answering those questions, what would you say?</p>

                    <h4>Housekeeping:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attendance is highly encouraged</li>
                        <li>Moodle is coming</li>

                    <p>Let's watch the introduction to this video and see if we can learn something about both the topic and how the creators navigate a complex set of sources and circumstances:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Examples of sources: What sources do they cite?</li>

                        <li>What might make us question the reputability or safety or correctness of a source?</li>
                        <li>Why is this topic complex and nuanced?</li>

                    <h4>Framing Project: The Humble Banana</h4>
                    <p>Dear students,</p>

                    <p>In this class, we will be discussing framing. More importantly, we will be discussing a highly contentious topic with broad and deep societal and historical significance: <strong>Bananas</strong>. This topic has too often been viewed as banal, mundane, quotidian, and other less fancy words for "everyday."</p>

                    <p>Together, we will approach this topic from four different frames, in an attempt to better understand not just the role of the humble banana in our society, but also how the way we frame facts changes their power, their relevance, and their scope. We will discuss argument, form, and tone, as well as investigating both what sources are easily accessible and what frames those resources contain within them.</p>

                    <h4>Pick Your Frame 🖼️</h4>
                    <p>Choose ONE of the following frames:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Big Banana:</strong> Economic and corporate perspective</li>
                        <li><strong>Bananas For All:</strong> Access, equity, and social justice perspective</li>
                        <li><strong>Badnana:</strong> Environmental and ethical concerns perspective</li>
                        <li><strong>BAN-Bananas:</strong> Critical analysis and activism perspective</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Your Tasks for Today:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Take out a laptop and sign in</li>
                        <li>Have a look at the four frames, pick a frame and let me know what you are interested in doing so we have an equal number for each one</li>
                        <li>Start working on research and writing!</li>
