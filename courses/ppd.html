            <h2>Welcome to PPD!</h2>
            <p>My name is Josh—together we will embark on an adventure in learning a bit more about ourselves, understanding our goals and how to achieve them.</p>

            <p>If you have had a Personal and Professional development class in the past, you might find that my interpretation is a bit different than your prior experiences.</p>

            <h3>What We Will (Broadly) Cover:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Processes for understanding what your goals are and how you can best achieve them</li>
                <li>How systems and structures work and change (and how you relate to that change)</li>
                <li>How to translate your goals into a series of steps and projects</li>
                <li>How to gauge whether you have learned something sufficiently to move forward</li>
                <li>Investigate and use a variety of tools to help you in this and other classes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How You Will Be Assessed This Year:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>50% Skills Demonstrations:</strong> in class</li>
                <li><strong>50% Portfolio/Collection of Work:</strong> in and outside of class with 1:1 feedback</li>
            </ul>

                        <li><strong>Starting Reflection:</strong> To start, write out what you expect to find in the resources... how will they look, will they be helpful? Where will you find good resources?</li>
                        <li>Let's search through and find 3+ resources each that describe what makes a good CV for a recent student</li>

                                <li>Is the CV easy to read, or overly flashy?</li>
                                <li>How does the CV handle when there is not much content?</li>
                                <li>How does the advice apply to someone who is changing careers?</li>
