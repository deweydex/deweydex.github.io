                <li>How we might relate to others in our professional lives to achieve our specific goals</li>
                <li>What new tools are available that might make various forms of communication easier (and which might make things tricky or more difficult)</li>
            </ul>

                <div class="detail-content">
                    <h4>Getting Started</h4>
                    <p>Please fill out the "Getting to Know You as a Human Being Form". Note, the more you type, the better I can understand your situation and tailor assignments and feedback to your specific background, circumstances and goals.</p>

                    <h4>Introductory Task</h4>
                    <p>On a new word doc, please draft the following scenario and then an email that outlines an initial communication with a client that has expressed interest in working with you on a creative project:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>What project are you working on with this person (can be real, or invented)</li>
                        <li>How will you be billing this person?</li>
                        <li>What information do you need to get started on the project?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Housekeeping:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attendance is highly encouraged</li>
                        <li>Moodle is coming</li>
                        <li>This site is where a lot of stuff will live</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Frustration</li>
                        <li>Anxiety</li>

                        <li>Confidence</li>

                        <li>Determination...</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>What are some things you noticed while writing? What was difficult, what was easy? What did you change from the beginning to the end of the process?</p>

                <div class="detail-content">
                    <h4>Plan for Today:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recap from Last Week</li>
                        <li>Introductory Task</li>
                        <li>Communicating about Art and Process (A Youtube Example)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Introductory Task (1h)</h4>
                    <p>On a new word doc, let's think through a few things involving communication with clients based on the following scenario:</p>

                    <p><em>A new local restaurant who you have never worked with before would like to commission your work (paintings, tableware, statue, mosaics, other endeavour relevant to your practice).</em></p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>What is the scope of the project? What will you be creating for them? If that has not yet been decided, how will you go about determining that?</li>
                        <li>How will you be billing this person? How will you ascertain pricing and budgeting?</li>
                        <li>What information do you need to get started on the project? Assume you do not have the details.</li>
                        <li>Propose a meeting (time, day etc.) and prepare an agenda for the meeting.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Looking at an Example Together</h4>
                    <p>Let's use the following prompts to discuss a YouTube Video together: as we watch through, see if you can address these points individually:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What do you notice about the tone of the speaker?</li>
                        <li>What do you notice about the visuals, the focus, the lighting (cinematography)?</li>
                        <li>What do you notice about how the speaker refers to themselves, to the audience?</li>
                        <li>What emotions do you think the creator is trying to evoke in their viewers? What emotions do you actually feel?</li>
                        <li>What do you notice about the structure of the video, of each scene?</li>
                        <li>What vocabulary do you see the creator use, what level (or register) are they speaking in?</li>
                        <li>Who do you think the primary audience is for this video?</li>
                    </ul>

                <summary>October 6 & 13: Grants & Residencies Research</summary>
                <div class="detail-content">
                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>Today we will be investigating some funding, learning and travel opportunities associated with your practice. If you are not sure if you want to do these, that's okay, learning about what is out there and figuring out what you are not interested in can be just as important as finding your thing!</p>

                    <p>Several artists I know have talked about residencies or grants as being what made them decide to go full time, or to change their practice to being alongside a more traditional 9-5. Everyone is different—the key for us here is finding out what is out there and maybe changing our idea about what is possible or realistic.</p>

                    <h4>Grants & Residencies Research Activity</h4>
                    <p>This activity asks you to research real funding and residency opportunities that exist for artists in Ireland and internationally. The goal is to demystify the grants landscape and help you understand what kinds of support are actually available.</p>

                    <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
                    <p>Grants and residencies can provide:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Time:</strong> Dedicated space to develop work without the pressure of immediate sales</li>
                        <li><strong>Money:</strong> Materials budgets, living stipends, or both</li>
                        <li><strong>Space:</strong> Access to specialized equipment, studios, or locations</li>
                        <li><strong>Community:</strong> Connection with other artists, mentors, or new audiences</li>
                        <li><strong>Legitimacy:</strong> Recognition that strengthens future applications and your CV</li>
                        <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Opportunities to develop new skills or techniques</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>The Task</h4>
                    <p>Research grants and residency opportunities from the following categories and select THREE different opportunities that interest you. At least one should be based in Ireland.</p>

                    <h5>Research Sources:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Irish National Level:</strong> Arts Council of Ireland / An Chomhairle Ealaíon</li>
                        <li><strong>Local Council & Libraries:</strong> Dublin City Council Arts Office, your local county council</li>
                        <li><strong>Dublin Studios & Organizations:</strong> Fire Station Artists' Studios, Temple Bar Gallery + Studios, Block T</li>
                        <li><strong>Irish Residencies:</strong> Tyrone Guthrie Centre, The Mattress Factory, Cill Rialaig Project, Cow House Studios</li>
                        <li><strong>International Residencies:</strong> Res Artis, TransArtists, Alliance of Artists Communities, Tokyo Arts and Space, Vermont Studio Center</li>
                    </ul>
