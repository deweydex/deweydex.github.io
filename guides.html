            <h2>How to Learn Programming</h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>This guide will hopefully be a little bit different from most guides out there on how to learn programming in the mid 2020s. I will indeed give some concrete advice about what one can use and steps to get started, but the Resources and Recommendations Page contains more context specific suggestions for specific subjects and use cases.</p>

            <h3>What Do You Mean By Programming?</h3>
            <p>In my experience there are at least five types of programming: they are certainly all related, but the task of "learning programming" usually involves starting to learn one of these broader types:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Programming Contests or Puzzles</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Scientific or Financial Programming</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Programming Applications</strong> (Back-end, mid-layer, native)</li>
                <li><strong>Graphics, Front-End and Web Programming</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Low-Level Programming</strong></li>
            </ol>

            <p><em>Note:</em> Some areas require practices and ideas and languages from more than one of these broad types. In particular, learning how to create computer games likely involves learning several ways of thinking about programming, especially graphics heavy games or games involving complex mechanics.</p>

            <h3>A Coding Process for Bigger Challenges</h3>

            <p>When confronted with a programming challenge, especially one which appears to be pretty big and where you aren't sure where to begin, there are a few basic rules of thumb which can do wonders for your confidence:</p>

            <h4>Before You Code</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Write the introduction or assignment brief in your own words:</strong> This will help you to highlight the parts you find important and also give you a chance to figure out what you don't understand</li>

                <li><strong>Think through what variables you might need:</strong> Note down what type of variables they might be. If you are not sure of what datatype to use, think through what you need the variables to do</li>

                <li><strong>Write out a list of the behaviours:</strong> Break down each bigger behaviour into as many substeps as you can</li>

                <li><strong>Think through the conditions:</strong> What if/else statements do you need to check? If you are able to see how those behaviours might map to functions, think through what you need each function to take as input and output</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> All of the above can be done in any text document, or on paper. Some folks are planners, and others write lots of comments in their code. Don't be afraid to use the simplest text editor you can!</p>

            <h4>When You Start Coding</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Start defining variables and functions with names that make sense to you:</strong> A good variable name is descriptive and often might be longer than we would like. The worst thing is an abbreviated name that you can't recognize later!</li>

                <li><strong>Comments are your friends!</strong> Describe your thoughts and intentions as you code. This will help you solve problems before they happen</li>

                <li><strong>Print statements are also your friends!</strong> If you need to check the state of a variable, go ahead and print it out with a little string that says where that print-out happened</li>

                <li><strong>Not knowing what is next is normal:</strong> Starting is more important than being correct. Writing a plan will help you find your footing</li>

                <li><strong>Everyone uses documentation:</strong> Not remembering something is to be expected. Learning how documentation works is part of learning how to code</li>

                <li><strong>Complete the minimum required first:</strong> Then start expanding. It can be too easy to get lost in the part of the project you enjoy</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>How to Learn Mathematics</h2>

            <h3>What We Learn in School</h3>
            <p>In high school, mathematics is often presented as a series of algorithms to memorize and procedures to follow. While this approach can help with standardized tests, it rarely builds deep understanding or appreciation for mathematical thinking.</p>

            <h3>A Different Approach</h3>
            <p>In my courses, we focus on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understanding concepts</strong> rather than memorizing procedures</li>
                <li><strong>Seeing patterns</strong> and connections between different areas of mathematics</li>
                <li><strong>Using programming</strong> to make abstract concepts concrete</li>
                <li><strong>Building intuition</strong> through visualization and experimentation</li>
                <li><strong>Asking "why"</strong> instead of just "how"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Principles</h3>

            <h4>1. Objects and Functions</h4>
            <p>Think of mathematics as a way of describing objects (numbers, shapes, data) and functions (operations we can perform on those objects). This perspective makes mathematics more like a language for describing patterns.</p>

            <h4>2. Multiple Representations</h4>
            <p>Any mathematical concept can usually be represented in multiple ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Numerically (with numbers and calculations)</li>
                <li>Graphically (with pictures and diagrams)</li>
                <li>Algebraically (with symbols and equations)</li>
                <li>In code (with programs and algorithms)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Practice and Exploration</h4>
            <p>Mathematics is learned through practice, but not mindless repetition. Instead:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with problems that interest you</li>
                <li>Experiment and make mistakes</li>
                <li>Look for patterns in your solutions</li>
                <li>Create your own practice problems</li>
                <li>Explain concepts to others</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How I Recommend Learning to Learn</h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p><em>Note to the reader:</em> For this guide we are going to focus on subjects that do not require significant physical space or tools.</p>

            <h3>The Core Idea</h3>
            <p>Learning how to learn is perhaps the most valuable skill you can develop. Here are some principles I've found helpful:</p>

            <h4>1. Understand Your Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>What do you actually want to achieve?</li>
                <li>Why does this matter to you?</li>
                <li>What will success look like?</li>
                <li>What's your timeline?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Find Your Learning Style</h4>
            <p>Different people learn differently. Some learn best through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reading and writing</li>
                <li>Watching videos and demonstrations</li>
                <li>Hands-on practice and experimentation</li>
                <li>Discussion and teaching others</li>
                <li>Problem-solving and projects</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>The key:</strong> Don't force yourself into someone else's learning style. Experiment and find what works for YOU.</p>

            <h4>3. Active vs. Passive Learning</h4>
            <p><strong>Passive learning:</strong> Watching videos, reading textbooks, listening to lectures<br>
            <strong>Active learning:</strong> Solving problems, writing code, teaching concepts, creating projects</p>

            <p>Both have their place, but active learning typically leads to deeper understanding. Use passive learning to get oriented, then switch to active learning as quickly as possible.</p>

            <h4>4. The Power of Reflection</h4>
            <p>After working on something, take time to reflect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What did I learn?</li>
                <li>What was challenging? Why?</li>
                <li>What connections can I see to other things I know?</li>
                <li>What would I do differently next time?</li>
                <li>What questions do I still have?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>5. Building Habits</h4>
            <p>Consistent practice beats intense bursts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set a regular time for learning</li>
                <li>Start small (15-30 minutes is better than nothing)</li>
                <li>Track your progress</li>
                <li>Celebrate small wins</li>
                <li>Be patient with yourself</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Resources Are Everywhere</h3>
            <p>In the modern era, the challenge isn't finding resources—it's choosing which ones to use. Here's how to navigate:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start with one resource</strong> and give it a fair try before switching</li>
                <li><strong>Look for resources that match your level</strong> (not too easy, not too hard)</li>
                <li><strong>Check the date</strong> (especially for technical subjects)</li>
                <li><strong>Read reviews and recommendations</strong> from people you trust</li>
                <li><strong>Don't be afraid to switch</strong> if something isn't working</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Importance of Community</h3>
            <p>Learning is social:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find study groups or learning partners</li>
                <li>Join online communities related to your subject</li>
                <li>Ask questions (someone else probably has the same question)</li>
                <li>Help others when you can (teaching reinforces learning)</li>
                <li>Share your progress and celebrate others' progress</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Independent Learning Plans</h2>

            <p>During most classes with me, each of us will generally be learning at our own pace, punctuated by group practice or discussion. In order for that to work, and for all of us to better learn how to set goals and take responsibility of our own learning, occasionally we will each create an Independent Learning Plan.</p>

            <h3>Key Questions:</h3>

            <h4>1. What will you accomplish over what period of time?</h4>
            <p>Think of a STAR Goal framework:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SPECIFIC:</strong> Define what you want to achieve</li>
                <li><strong>TIMELY:</strong> When do you want to achieve the goal?</li>
                <li><strong>ACTION ORIENTED:</strong> How will you achieve the goal?</li>
                <li><strong>REALISTIC:</strong> Is the goal attainable? What might stand in your way?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. How will you accomplish your goal?</h4>
            <p>Discuss what resources you will use as well as what amount of time you will spend. What specific actions will you take? Where will you find your exercises?</p>

            <h4>3. What challenges might stand in your way?</h4>
            <p>What might make accomplishing your goal difficult? Most importantly: what will you do to overcome those challenges?</p>

            <p>Sometimes the biggest challenges we face are physical, feeling tired, or unfocused. Sometimes it is not clear what the next steps should be. This section is about outlining the real and present issues we might face.</p>

            <p>You are welcome (encouraged even!) to send me your plans and discuss them with me in class.</p>
