                <span>Am I allowed to use ChatGPT and other LLM/AI tools?</span>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes! AI tools like ChatGPT are allowed and even encouraged in my courses. However, it's important to understand how to use them effectively:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Learning tool, not replacement:</strong> AI tools should help you understand concepts, not replace your thinking. Use them to explain difficult topics, generate examples, or debug code.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demonstrate understanding:</strong> In your submissions, you need to show that you understand what you're submitting. Simply copying AI output without understanding it won't help you learn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cite when appropriate:</strong> If AI significantly contributed to your work, mention it in your reflection or documentation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remember the goal:</strong> Learning happens in your head. AI is a tool to facilitate that learning, like a textbook or tutorial.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">
                <span>How will I be graded?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Grading in my courses focuses on demonstrating mastery and progress rather than one-time performance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Project-based and competency-based:</strong> Most assessments are either online resources or project-based, allowing you to demonstrate specific competencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple opportunities:</strong> You won't receive a terminal grade after one attempt. You'll have opportunities to improve based on feedback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Evidence of learning:</strong> Your grade reflects the effort and engagement you demonstrate through participation, submissions, and reflections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Individual progress:</strong> Success takes into account where you started and how far you've progressed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Check your specific course page for the exact breakdown (typically 50% skills demonstrations and 50% collection of work).</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">
                <span>How can I improve my grade?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>There are several ways to improve your grade throughout the course:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Engage with feedback:</strong> Read and apply the feedback you receive on assignments and projects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Revise and resubmit:</strong> Most assignments can be revised and improved. Show that you've learned from feedback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Submit reflections:</strong> Reflections help me understand your learning process and where you might need support.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communicate:</strong> If you're struggling, reach out. The more I understand your situation, the better I can help.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demonstrate effort:</strong> Consistent engagement with course materials and regular submissions show your commitment to learning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complete optional work:</strong> Going beyond minimum requirements demonstrates deeper understanding.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">
                <span>Do I have to do reflections?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Reflections are an important part of the learning process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Required component:</strong> Yes, reflections are part of your assessment and help demonstrate your learning journey.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> They help you think about what you've learned, what was challenging, and how you've grown.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication tool:</strong> Reflections help me understand where you might need extra support or resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Format:</strong> Usually brief - focus on quality over quantity. What did you learn? What was difficult? What changed?</li>
                    <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Typically at the end of each class (intention setting at the start, reflection at the end).</li>

                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The flexible approach to deadlines is intentional:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Self-paced learning:</strong> Everyone learns at different speeds. You can work at a pace that suits your understanding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-world skills:</strong> Managing your own time and priorities is a valuable professional skill.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality over speed:</strong> Focus on truly understanding the material rather than rushing to meet arbitrary deadlines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication is key:</strong> While there aren't strict due dates, you should communicate your progress regularly through check-ins and project updates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Course completion:</strong> Keep in mind there are still overall course timelines and semester end dates to work within.</li>
                </ul>

                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Check-ins are informal progress conversations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To discuss your progress, challenges, and next steps.</li>
                    <li><strong>Format:</strong> Usually a brief 1-on-1 conversation during class time or office hours.</li>
                    <li><strong>What to prepare:</strong> Be ready to discuss what you've been working on, what's going well, and where you're stuck.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feedback opportunity:</strong> A chance to get personalized guidance and clarify any confusion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not an evaluation:</strong> It's a supportive conversation, not a formal assessment.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Project updates should be concise but informative:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quality over quantity:</strong> A few well-thought-out sentences are better than pages of filler.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key information:</strong> What have you done? What are you working on next? Any blockers or challenges?</li>
                    <li><strong>Typical length:</strong> Usually a paragraph or two (3-5 sentences) is sufficient.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Instead of "working on the assignment," say "implemented the user login function and started on database integration."</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular updates:</strong> Brief regular updates are more valuable than occasional long ones.</li>

                    <li><strong>Minimum viable product first:</strong> Get the core requirements working before adding extras.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reflection component:</strong> Most projects include a reflection on what you learned.</li>
                    <li><strong>When in doubt, ask:</strong> Submit what you have and ask for feedback if you're unsure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Iterative improvement:</strong> Remember, you can improve and resubmit based on feedback.</li>
