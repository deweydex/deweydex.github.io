            <p>My teaching philosophy and pedagogical approaches</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Core Belief: Learning Happens in Your Head</h2>
            <p>The most important thing to understand about my approach to teaching is this: <strong>learning happens in your head, not in the classroom.</strong> I can't make you learn anything. What I can do is create an environment where learning is more likely to happen, provide resources and guidance, and help remove obstacles in your path.</p>

            <p>Most of the actual learning will happen on your own time—whether at home, a coffee shop, the library, or anywhere else you choose to work. My role is to facilitate, guide, and support that process, not to be the sole source of knowledge.</p>

            <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

            <h3>Education as Liberation</h3>
            <p>My approach is informed by progressive education and the praxis-oriented methods of Paulo Freire. Education should be liberating, not just about depositing information into students' heads (what Freire called the "banking model"). Instead, learning should be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dialogical:</strong> A conversation between teacher and student, not a one-way transfer</li>
                <li><strong>Critical:</strong> Encouraging students to question, analyze, and think for themselves</li>
                <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Connected to students' lives, goals, and the real world</li>
                <li><strong>Empowering:</strong> Building confidence and agency, not dependence</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Students as Whole People</h3>
            <p>You are not just a student—you're a person with a life outside this classroom. You have responsibilities, challenges, interests, and goals that extend far beyond any single course. I try to remember this in how I structure my courses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flexible deadlines that respect your need to manage multiple priorities</li>
                <li>Multiple pathways to demonstrate understanding</li>
                <li>Recognition that illness, emergencies, and life happen</li>
                <li>Focus on learning and growth rather than punishment for struggles</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How This Translates to Practice</h2>

            <h3>Assessment Philosophy</h3>
            <p>I don't believe in terminal grades or single-chance assessments. Instead:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multiple opportunities:</strong> You can revise and improve based on feedback</li>
                <li><strong>Competency-based:</strong> Demonstrating mastery matters more than when you demonstrate it</li>
                <li><strong>Growth-oriented:</strong> Your grade reflects where you started and how far you've come</li>
                <li><strong>Portfolio approach:</strong> A collection of work over time, not one-off exams</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Role of Struggle</h3>
            <p>Struggling is not failing—it's learning. The moments when you're stuck, confused, or frustrated are often when the most important learning happens. My goal is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a safe space where it's okay to struggle and make mistakes</li>
                <li>Help you develop strategies for working through challenges</li>
                <li>Celebrate effort and persistence, not just correct answers</li>
                <li>Model my own learning process, including my struggles and mistakes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Effort and Engagement</h3>
            <blockquote>
                "The more effort you put in, the more you engage with the material and methods in this course, and the more you demonstrate that effort through participation, submission of assignments, and reflections, the more easily I can see what you've learned."
            </blockquote>

            <p>I can't read minds. The only way I know you're learning is through the evidence you provide: your work, your reflections, your questions, your participation. The more you show me, the better I can support you.</p>

            <h2>Practical Implications</h2>

            <h3>Why Reflections Matter</h3>
            <p>Reflections aren't busywork—they're metacognition. When you reflect on what you've learned, what was challenging, and how you overcame difficulties, you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Solidify your learning by articulating it</li>
                <li>Help me understand where you need support</li>
                <li>Develop self-awareness about your own learning process</li>
                <li>Create a record of your growth over time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why There Aren't Always Due Dates</h3>
            <p>Flexible deadlines teach you to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Manage your own time and priorities</li>
                <li>Develop intrinsic motivation rather than external compliance</li>
                <li>Work at a pace that supports deep understanding, not just completion</li>
                <li>Practice the kind of self-direction you'll need in professional life</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This doesn't mean "whenever" or "never"—there are still semester endpoints and course timelines. It means trusting you to manage your learning journey within reasonable bounds.</p>

            <h3>Why Communication is Essential</h3>
            <p>I can't help if I don't know there's a problem. Communication is a two-way street:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I commit to being clear about expectations and responsive to questions</li>
                <li>You commit to letting me know when you're struggling, confused, or need support</li>
                <li>We both treat each other with respect and professionalism</li>
                <li>We recognize that miscommunication happens and work to resolve it</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What I Ask of You</h2>

            <h3>Mutual Respect</h3>
            <p>Respect your own learning process, respect your classmates' learning processes, and respect the shared space we create together.</p>

            <h3>Self-Honesty</h3>
            <p>Be honest with yourself about what you understand and what you don't. Be honest about the effort you're putting in. Be honest about what you need.</p>

            <h3>Active Engagement</h3>
            <p>Show up (physically and mentally), participate, ask questions, try things, make mistakes, and learn from them.</p>

            <h3>Communication</h3>
            <p>Tell me what's going on. If you're struggling, confused, overwhelmed, or excited about something—let me know.</p>

            <h2>What You Can Expect from Me</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Clear expectations, grading criteria, and rationale for decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Timely replies to questions and feedback on work</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Willingness to adjust when life happens</li>
                <li><strong>High expectations:</strong> I believe you can learn this material and will challenge you appropriately</li>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> Resources, guidance, and encouragement when you need it</li>
                <li><strong>Humanity:</strong> Recognition that we're all human, and that's okay</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

            <p>Teaching isn't about being the "sage on the stage" who dispenses wisdom. It's about being a "guide on the side" who helps you find your own path to understanding. My goal isn't to make you dependent on me for knowledge, but to help you become an independent learner who knows how to find, evaluate, and apply information.</p>

            <p>This means sometimes letting you struggle (with support), sometimes stepping back when you're ready, and always believing that you have the capacity to learn and grow.</p>
