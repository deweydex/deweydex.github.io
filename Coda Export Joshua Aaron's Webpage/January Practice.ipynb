You may use whatever resources you would like to help you complete them, though I recommend having a look at the C# Cheat Sheet on Codecademy or using the documentation in Visual Studio. Please avoid the use of a LLM Based AI model for this task. If you have any questions please raise your hand and I will come around.\n",

    "Let's try to code a function that implements digit addition using lists. To do this, lets create a function `gradeschool_addition` that takes in two lists of the same length which contain only single digit positive integers as each list element. This function would return a new list (potentially a slightly longer list) which represents the digit (gradeschool) addition of the two lists: so adding 1234 + 2345 would give 3579 normally, but in our case we would have `gradeschool_addition([1,2,3,4],[2,3,4,5]) -> [3,5,7,9]` (see how the lists are basically numbers)?"
