    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through a simple space map system inspired by \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\" We'll build a mini-map for a text-based RPG where players can navigate a spaceship between different locations in the galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\" that contain both data (attributes) and code (methods). OOP helps organize code in a way that models real-world entities and their relationships, making complex systems more manageable, modular, and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key OOP Concepts We'll Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classes and Objects**: Blueprint definitions and their instances\n",
    "2. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that work on that data\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**: Using a single interface for different underlying forms\n",
    "5. **Composition**: Building complex objects by combining simpler ones\n",

    "## Summary of OOP Concepts Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Classes and Objects\n",
    "- We defined several classes (`Location`, `Planet`, `SpaceStation`, `SpaceMap`, `Spaceship`)\n",
    "- We created instances of these classes (objects) that encapsulate state and behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Encapsulation\n",
    "- Each class bundles data (attributes) with the methods that operate on that data\n",
    "- Implementation details are hidden inside the classes, providing a clean interface for users\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Inheritance\n",
    "- `Planet` and `SpaceStation` inherit from `Location`\n",
    "- They reuse code from their parent class while adding specialized features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Polymorphism\n",
    "- The `get_info()` method behaves differently depending on the object's class\n",
    "- We can call the same method on different types of objects, and it does the right thing\n",
    "- Runtime type checking with `isinstance()` allows specialized behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Composition\n",
    "- `SpaceMap` is composed of `Location` objects\n",
    "- `Spaceship` has a `SpaceMap`\n",
    "- This creates a hierarchy of objects that work together\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises for Further Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Try extending this system with some of these ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a new location type (e.g., `Asteroid`, `BlackHole`, `SpacePort`)\n",
    "2. Implement an inventory system for collecting and using items\n",
    "3. Add NPCs (Non-Player Characters) with dialogue\n",
    "4. Create a mission or quest system\n",
    "5. Add different spaceship types with varying fuel capacities\n",
    "6. Implement a combat system for dangerous encounters\n",
    "7. Add a save/load game functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these extensions would demonstrate additional OOP principles and practices."
