## YOUR MISSION

Welcome to Big Banana. You didn't choose the banana life; the banana life chose you.

As part of our ongoing efforts to maintain banana market dominance, we need fresh content that positions bananas as the essential fruit choice for consumers. Your task is to create **marketing material** (article, social media campaign, infographic, or video script) that accomplishes our organizational goals.

## OUR FRAME: WHAT WE STAND FOR

- **Economic prosperity:** Bananas create jobs (don't worry too much about where or what kind)
- **Affordable nutrition:** Bananas are cost-effective compared to organic blueberries or whatever
- **Convenience:** Pre-wrapped by nature! Portable! No washing required!
- **Tradition:** Bananas have been part of breakfast for generations
- **Scientific progress:** Modern agriculture means consistent, perfect fruit year-round
- **Global trade:** Bananas connect markets and build international relationships

## YOUR ASSIGNMENT

Create a 300-400 word piece OR equivalent media content that:

1. **Emphasizes banana benefits** while using selective facts
2. **Targets one of these audiences:**
   - Health-conscious millennials
   - Budget-conscious families
   - School administrators (for cafeteria contracts)
   - Fitness enthusiasts
   - Grocery store buyers

3. **Subtly addresses concerns** without amplifying them
   - If mentioning labor: "thousands of jobs" (not conditions)
   - If mentioning environment: "natural" and "sustainable farming practices"
   - If mentioning monoculture: "consistency" and "quality control"
   - If mentioning corporate history: "proud heritage" and "industry leadership"

4. **Uses persuasive techniques:**
   - Statistics that sound impressive (potassium content, affordability per calorie)
   - Expert endorsements (nutritionists, athletes)
   - Emotional appeals (childhood memories, family health)
   - Solving problems (energy, nutrition, convenience)

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**You've succeeded if:**
- Readers feel positive about banana purchases
- Concerns about production are minimized or reframed as strengths
- Bananas seem like the obvious choice compared to alternatives
- The piece appears educational rather than purely commercial
- Your frame is subtle enough that readers don't feel "sold to"

**You've failed if:**
- Readers question banana production practices
- Your audience becomes curious about labor or environmental issues
- The piece feels like obvious corporate propaganda
- You accidentally highlight controversial facts
- Readers switch to local apples or something

## FACT-FINDING MISSION

After drafting your piece, identify **3 real sources** you could cite to support your narrative. Consider:
- Industry reports (favorable data)
- Nutrition studies (health benefits)
- Economic analyses (job numbers, trade value)
- Consumer surveys (satisfaction, popularity)

**Strategic question:** If a source mentions both benefits AND concerns, how would you quote it selectively?

## REMEMBER

We're not asking you to lie. We're asking you to emphasize certain truths over others. That's not propaganda—that's marketing.

*The banana industry thanks you for your service.*
