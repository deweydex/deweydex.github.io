    "# Skills Demo 1 Brief: Classless Store \n",
    "\n",
    "In this skills demo you will be tasked with creating a shop and maintaining a personal inventory. Here, we will outline a few functions and requirements for your shop, the items in it, and user interaction (and inventory maintenance). You are welcome to complete this assignment in any modern programming language, though of course we have focused on Python or C#. If you would like to use another programming language from those two, please speak to me so we can align on questions of code style and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo will be broken into 5 tasks, but you are welcome to (and it is in fact recommented that you) include other helper functions and global variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "1. Describe a series of items with associated costs, names, and quantities, establish how to store these in a list, series of lists, or list like structure. (5%)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define a series of variables for: (5%)\n",
    "    - storing your users inventory\n",
    "    - some means of purchasing or trading for new items\n",
    "    - a means of storing your shops inventory \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Design two functions that display what is available at your shop and what is in the users inventory. (10%)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Design a function that allows for the purchasing of an item: (10%)\n",
    "- make sure to check if appropriate trade or currency is available from the user\n",
    "- ensure the inventory of your shop and user are updated appropriately after purchase\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Introduce your user to your shop and provide a means for them to purchase another item, allow the user to exit the shop. (5%)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission Criteria:\n",
    "Please submit either a text file (.cs or .py) or notebook file .ipynb (whether python or polyglot notebook) to moodle at this link.\n",
    "Feel free to submit the completed ipynb version of this brief as your assignment. If you do, please break up your code into multiple cells (code and markdown), both for testing and grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to comment your code, not simply to say that you are using a given coding structure, but also to explain the choices you have made, and what difficulties or problems you solved along the way.\n",
    "If you are submitting a text file, please submit additional documentation in the form of a PDF document, if you are submitting an ipynb file then you may include your documentation and discussion within markdown cells  (the text cells) in your document. If you would like to include images please make sure that they are also submitted with your work with appropriate file names.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcome from Module Descriptor\n",
    "1. Demonstrate an understanding of the different data types used in object oriented programs\n",
    "4. Design and construct modular reusable code blocks\n",
    "5. Demonstrate familiarity with and work within, a modern integrated development environment\n",
    "6. Construct larger programs from smaller programs\n",
    "7. Model real‐world objects in order to build object oriented programs that model real‐world activities\n",
    "9. Properly document program code\n",
    "10. Debug and test programs\n",
    "11. Deploy programs to the end user via the front-end\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program interface should be designed using if and switch statements, lists, functions, arrays and/or datasets where appropriate. It should call relevant methods and logical program blocks. Your program should use appropriate data types to simulate and model the problem.\n"
