    "Remember: you are highly encouraged to start by writing pseudo-code (or just sentences describing what you would like to code). The more you write (in English, not code) the easier it will be to translate into code. For problems 1 through 3 the goal is to have a working, well commented function that passes the tests that you have written out. For problem 4, the goal is to outline how you might have to change problem 3, not having a working solution for challenge 4 will not affect your mark so long as you highlight where your function is not working and what test cases might help you diagnose the problem."

    "Let's try to code a function that implements digit addition using lists. To do this, lets create a function `gradeschool_addition` that takes in two lists of the same length which contain only single digit positive integers as each list element. This function would return a new list (potentially a slightly longer list) which represents the digit (gradeschool) addition of the two lists: so adding 1234 + 2345 would give 3579 normally, but in our case we would have `gradeschool_addition([1,2,3,4],[2,3,4,5]) -> [3,5,7,9]`(see how the lists are basically numbers)?"
