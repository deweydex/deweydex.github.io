## Philosophy on Adult Learning

In adult learning contexts, what habits and expectations an adult learner brings with them from their schooling is often more important than access to quality teachers or content.

## Teaching Materials

While the vast majority of work produced for organizations such as Nelson and Paper remains their property, there are a few exercises, learning materials, and workshops available with context surrounding their creation or delivery.

## Approach

My teaching and content styles are informed by:
- Progressive education movements in both European and American contexts
- Praxis-oriented methods of Paulo Freire
- Focus on what learners bring to the classroom
- Emphasis on transformative learning experiences
