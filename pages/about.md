This is the webpage of Joshua S. Aaron ... or at least a copy of one, this is a bit of an experiment
## Background

I am currently finishing a masters degree in Computer Science and Mathematics Education at the Free University. I have a background in the Tech and Startup world, have taught in Los Angeles as part of City Year, at the Nelson Mandela school as part of my Masters, and for the last few years have helped to run Archetyp Cafe, an experiment in social business.

## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching and content styles are informed by progressive education movements in both a European and American context, though are also influenced heavily by the praxis-oriented methods of Paulo Freire.

### Core Principles

- **Student-centered learning**: Empowering students to take ownership of their learning journey
- **Real-world application**: Connecting theoretical concepts to practical, meaningful projects
- **Critical thinking**: Encouraging students to question, analyze, and construct knowledge
- **Collaborative learning**: Building communities of practice where students learn from each other
