# Assignment Sheet 2: BANANAS FOR ALL

**COMMUNITY ORGANIZING KIT**

**FROM:** Bananas for All Coalition  
**TO:** Youth Organizers & Content Creators  
**RE:** Spread the Word Campaign

## OUR MOVEMENT

Bananas for All is a grassroots organization fighting for food justice, nutritional equity, and accessible healthy eating for all communities. We believe bananas are a powerful tool for social change—when produced and distributed ethically.

**We're the scrappy underdogs fighting against:**
- Food deserts and nutritional inequality
- Elitist "superfood" culture that shames affordable nutrition
- Corporate control of food narratives

**We're fighting FOR:**
- Affordable nutrition for low-income families
- Fair trade and worker-owned banana cooperatives
- Democratic food systems
- Breaking the stigma around "cheap" healthy foods

## YOUR FRAME: THE PEOPLE'S FRUIT

Bananas are:
- **Affordable:** Nutrition shouldn't be a luxury
- **Accessible:** Available even in food deserts where fresh produce is scarce
- **Democratic:** Not an elite organic product priced out of reach
- **Nourishing:** Real nutrition for working families
- **Resistance:** Against food apartheid and nutritional gatekeeping

## YOUR ASSIGNMENT

Create **activist content** (manifesto, community flyer, social media thread, PSA, or zine page) that:

1. **Champions bananas as a tool for food justice**
2. **Targets one of these audiences:**
   - Community organizers
   - Low-income families
   - Food justice advocates
   - School nutrition programs
   - Youth activists

3. **Addresses common criticisms from your frame:**
   - "But bananas aren't local!" → Talk about accessibility vs. food privilege
   - "Corporate banana companies are evil!" → Emphasize fair trade alternatives and worker cooperatives
   - "Bananas are boring!" → Challenge elitism in food culture
   - Environmental concerns → Acknowledge but emphasize that poor communities shouldn't bear responsibility for systemic issues

4. **Uses grassroots persuasion:**
   - Personal stories and testimonials
   - Challenge power structures
   - Statistics about food access
   - Moral urgency and justice framing
   - Community empowerment language

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**You've succeeded if:**
- Readers see bananas as connected to food justice
- The piece feels authentic and community-focused
- Middle-class readers question their food privilege
- Bananas become a symbol of accessible nutrition rights
- You inspire action (buying fair trade, supporting food programs)

**You've failed if:**
- Your piece feels preachy or disconnected from real struggles
- You ignore legitimate labor concerns to push pro-banana agenda
- Wealthy readers feel good without changing anything
- You accidentally romanticize poverty
- The piece comes off as corporate greenwashing in disguise

## RESEARCH CHALLENGE

Find **3 sources** that support the food justice case for bananas:
- Food desert statistics
- Nutrition cost comparisons
- Fair trade cooperative success stories
- Studies on food access and health outcomes
- Historical examples of food justice movements

**Critical question:** How do you acknowledge banana industry problems while still advocating for banana access? Where's the tension in your frame?

## REMEMBER

We're not shills for Big Banana. We're fighting for communities' right to affordable nutrition. This isn't about defending corporations—it's about defending people's access to healthy food without shame or gatekeeping.

The revolution will be potassium-rich.
