About Me

I love learning! This remains the strongest thread connecting the various endeavors and happenings of the past decade and a half. Those years have led me to various cities and jobs where I have had the good fortune of learning from fantastic teachers and students over the years. My original academic background is in Computer Science and Mathematics from McGill University in Montreal, but the most interesting and exciting stuff always seems to happen when one mixes the technical fields with the humanistic. My more recent academic focus lies in Machine Learning, Intelligent Systems (and their societal implications) while at the Technical University of Berlin, I am currently working towards a Masters in Human Centered Artificial Intelligence at Technical University of Dublin (Expected 2026).

Introduction

Over the course of this year, we will explore a series of concepts, tools and best practices regarding three different forms of what generally is called “Artificial Intelligence” but we will refer to as three distinct machine learning applications. This will mean dispelling some myths, uncovering and addressing some biases, and developing both facility and literacy surrounding how ML systems work, how they are sold to businesses, and how they are depicted in media. Hopefully this will enable us to better sort fact from fiction, use these tools effectively, ethically, and safely, and avoid both typical pitfalls and the snake-oil salesmen of today.

This is where our class summaries, reflection questions and other assignments will be posted, and you are welcome to email me with any questions or if you would like feedback on your assignments beyond what we discuss in class. After our initial explorations and building a solid digital foundation, some of the material of this course can be found on LinkedIn Learning (link and classroom forthcoming).  More information and a more concrete structure can be found in the following dropdowns—just click the little triangles on the left to expand! Looking forward to learning with you!

1 Introduction

Introductions: Who am I and Who are You?

On a sheet of paper please write the following in bullet point form:

* Your Full Name
* How you would like to be addressed
* A bit about your background, professional or personal
* What brought you to this class
* What you hope to learn in this class
* What is an unexpected application or use of AI or Machine learning that you have seen in recent years? Note: not necessarily the one that grabbed the most headlines, the one that surprised you, unsettled you or perhaps delighted you.

Next, see if you can write out your bullet points as sentences to make a nice paragraph or two.

Whimsy and Wile:

Please take the above bullet points (or a portion of them) and make them into a poem. You can use any rhyme or rhythmic scheme, but I recommend a limerick, sonnet, or simple AABB/ABAB scheme.

As you write: why am I asking you to write this poem? How does the task feel?

If you are not comfortable converting your text to a poem, please translate it into another language.

My Example Sentences.

My name is Joshua Aaron.

I would like to be addressed as Josh or Joshua, not sir or mister or any other title.

I have recently, in August, moved to Dublin from Toronto, where I lived for two years. Before Toronto I lived in Berlin for 8 years, and before that I lived in several cities throughout North America. I have taught, whether formally or informally, in three different cities, I have an academic background in computer science and mathematics, specifically artificial intelligence and machine learning and their relationship to education. I have run a cafe-community center in Berlin as well as managed teams in Education technology startups and social service oriented nonprofits. I hope my diverse background equips me with a breadth of examples and applications for this course.

I was brought to this class by Michael Foley, the principle of this college, as an attempt to see whether LinkedIn Learning could meet the academic needs of a course on AI, specifically in a non-technical capacity. 

As a new teacher to Ireland with a background in the subject, I am excited to learn from you and better understand what you are looking for in a course about AI, as there are so many out there in the ether these days. 

I am surprised at how quickly the educational applications of AI have been rolled out by the likes of Khan Academy, a site we will discuss later in this course.

Example Poem

Meet Your Instructor

Created with the help of Claude,

Joshua Aaron, that's my name,  
Just Josh or Joshua, if you please.  
From Toronto to Dublin I came,  
A journey across the seas.

Berlin for eight, then Canada's shore,  
A wanderer with knowledge to share.  
In tech and math, I've explored more,  
AI and learning - a fruitful pair.

From cafes to startups, I've led teams,  
In cities diverse, I've taught and learned.  
Now here to guide you through AI's themes,  
A breadth of examples I've earned.

Michael Foley brought me to this place,  
To test if LinkedIn Learning could  
Meet academic needs with grace,  
In AI's realm, as best we could.

As Ireland's new teacher, I'm keen  
To learn from you, to understand  
What you seek in AI's wide scene,  
Amidst the courses that now stand.

The speed of AI in education  
Surprises me, like Khan's quick stride.  
We'll explore this transformation,  
As through this course we all abide.



Example Translation

Lernen Sie Ihren Dozenten kennen

geschrieben mithilfe von Claude,

Joshua Aaron, so heiß' ich hier,
Josh oder Joshua, wie's euch gefällt.
Von Toronto nach Dublin, das war mein Weg,
Eine Reise quer durch die Welt.

Acht Jahre Berlin, dann Kanadas Küste,
Ein Wanderer, der Wissen teilt gern.
In Technik und Mathe hab' ich mich vertieft,
KI und Bildung, ein fruchtbares Paar.

Von Cafés bis Startups hab' Teams ich geführt,
In vielen Städten gelehrt und gelernt.
Jetzt führ' ich euch durch der KI weites Feld,
Mit Beispielen, die ich mir angeeignet.

Michael Foley brachte mich an diesen Ort,
Zu prüfen, ob LinkedIn Learning genügt
Den akademischen Ansprüchen hier,
Im KI-Bereich, so gut wir's vermögen.

Als Irlands neuer Lehrer bin ich gespannt,
Von euch zu lernen, zu verstehen,
Was ihr in KI-Kursen sucht und braucht,
In der Fülle, die heute bestehen.

Die Geschwindigkeit der KI in der Bildung
Überrascht mich, wie Khans schneller Schritt.
Wir werden diese Wandlung erforschen,
Während wir diesen Kurs gemeinsam bestreiten.



Some Questions for us to Consider

1. How do we determine a tool is fit to purpose?
2. What data questions might we ask of Machine Learning Applications?
3. What concerns might we have of new AI/ML tools?
4. What resources might we use to better educate ourselves on this and related topics?
5. How do we know if a source is credible?
6. What kind of media literacy did I need to navigate the digital world without AI/ML? What types of literacy are now more, or less, important?
7. How can an AI/ML application save me time or effort? Where should we be skeptical of time-saving promises?
8. How can we gain the computer literacy needed to be able to use these tools?

Questions for me?



2 Exploring Basic Tools

Establishing Baselines:

Original

Before we jump into how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) work I would like for us to look at a few different tools together. Sometimes the applications we use everyday have aspects that are based on ML and AI and we don’t even know it! When we look at a given application there are at least three lenses we might employ: understanding the right context in which to use that tool, what difficulties and pitfalls might arise, and how we might engage these tools safely and conscientiously. As we go through these applications there are a few questions and ideas we might consider: what does the tool claim to do and how? What data is collected? How is that data used? (For a more full list see below, but feel free to add your own!) Each of the tools (or applications) below use AI/ML in a variety of ways in order to help you accomplish various tasks. You may already have accounts for some of these sites, and while it is not required to make an account for this course, you might find it useful to do so for your professional goals. 

Tool 1: Summarize

The text highlights the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in everyday applications, prompting users to consider the tools' functionalities, data collection methods, and safe engagement. It suggests exploring various tools that leverage AI/ML to accomplish tasks efficiently, emphasizing the optional but potentially beneficial aspect of creating accounts on these platforms for professional purposes.

Tool 2: Shorten

The text discusses how AI and ML are used in everyday apps, urging users to explore tools that utilize these technologies for efficient task completion. It suggests considering functionalities, data collection, and safe usage, with optional account creation on these platforms for professional benefits.

Tool 3: Bullet Points

* Explore different tools together before diving into AI and ML
* Everyday apps may have hidden AI and ML features
* Three lenses to consider when looking at an application: right context, potential difficulties, safe engagement
* Questions to ponder: what the tool claims to do, data collection methods, data usage
* Tools use AI/ML in various ways to assist in task completion
* Optional account creation on platforms for professional goals

Tool 4: Convert to Table

Key Points
* Explore different tools together before diving into AI and ML
* Everyday apps may have hidden AI and ML features
* Three lenses to consider when looking at an application: right context, potential difficulties, safe engagement
* Questions to ponder: what the tool claims to do, data collection methods, data usage
* Tools use AI/ML in various ways to assist in task completion
* Optional account creation on platforms for professional goals


Tool 5: Simpler Language (with some emotional difficulties)

Before we talk about how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) work, let's check out some tools together. Many apps we use every day actually use AI and ML without us knowing. When we look at an app, we can think about three things: when to use it, what problems can come up, and how to use it safely. As we explore these apps, we can ask: what does the app do and how? What information does it gather, and how is it used? The tools below use AI/ML in different ways to help you with tasks. You might already have accounts on some of these sites, and while making an account for this course is optional, it could be helpful for your job.

Tool 6: Elaborate (Whoa boy):

3: Elaboration on AI and ML Tools

Before delving into the intricacies of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) operate, it's essential to explore various tools that we interact with daily. Many applications we use unknowingly leverage AI and ML technologies. When examining these tools, we can adopt different perspectives: understanding the appropriate context for their usage, identifying potential challenges and risks, and ensuring ethical and safe engagement with these tools.

In the exploration of these applications, several questions and considerations may arise:

* What functionalities does the tool offer, and how does it achieve them?
* What type of data is collected by the tool?
* How is this data utilized to enhance user experience and outcomes?

The following tools or applications utilize AI/ML in diverse ways to assist users in accomplishing a range of tasks. While creating accounts on these platforms is optional for this course, it can be beneficial for advancing your professional objectives.

Today’s Plan:

* Introduction: trying things out
* Discussion of AI/ML Tools and how we will investigate
* Investigation of AI/ML Tools
* Critical Reflection: key questions and goals

Tools we will explore:

* Google Docs
* Google Sheets
* Grammarly
* LinkedIn
* Coda
* Notion
* Canva
* Figma

Key Questions:

1. What does the AI portion of this tool claim to do?
  1. How fast or easy is it to use?
  2. How fast or easy is it to correct when a mistake is made?
  3. How fast or easy is it to opt-out (not use) this tool?
2. What kind of information or data does the AI portion of this tool give me?
  1. What kind of resources does this tool have access to?
  2. How does what I write factor into what is produced?
  3. What kind of options does this tool give me when I use it?
3. What kind of information is collected?
  1. Where does that data go?
  2. How is my data used?
  3. How can I opt out (or in) to this data collection?

Conclusions and Next Steps:

* Over the course of the next few weeks we will look at a variety of applications of AI/ML through tools such as these.
* Is there a particular tool you are interested in exploring and learning about? (There are many more than the ones we have discussed here, from Photoshop to WhatsApp!)
* Is there a particular feature that you are particularly intrigued or enthused by?
* Is there a particular tool you would like to learn better?

4: Accounts and IT Foundations

Going forward, it would be helpful to you in your job search to have a few accounts set up that involve AI tools:

* LinkedIn
* Google Gemini
* Microsoft Copilot
* Grammarly
* Claude
* ChatGPT

For today, lets just see how things go with signing into those resources and let’s discuss the explorations we did last week. Hopefully, next week we will have some access to LinkedIn Learning so that we can dive deeper into some AI concepts.

Some questions to consider: what do I find difficult about signing into these resources and learning how they work? How might I learn about these sites and make that difficulty (and potential stress/anxiety) go away or lessen? What are these sites trying to make faster or easier, who do they say they are for? (Hint, its usually not everyone!) When you use them, how might they make things easier for you?

5: Individualized Learning Plans

For the remainder of this course we will begin to use Individualized Learning Plans so that each of us can learn and explore at our own pace and toward slightly different, individually appropriate outcomes.

We will use a form to start creating our learning plan, and every few weeks we will reassess, see how the last plan went, and think through next steps. At the link below you can find some more description of what an independent learning plan looks like, and at the second link you will find a form where you can begin writing. Please select that you would like to receive a copy of your responses or print-to-PDF so that you can maintain access to your responses!

6: Accounts (Continued) LinkedIn etc.

Today lets see if we can get a couple (very different feeling) things sorted:

1. Create a LinkedIn account, if you have one already move on to the next step!
2. Ensure that your LinkedIn profile is both up to date and reflects your goals using some of the tools we have discussed previously, are there any text-generators that you found particularly useful? 
3. While working on this, take a couple minutes to complete the following: For this week, create a plan for what type of online presence you would like to create and maintain, our independent learning plan sheet might be a good place to start. Next week we will see where AI-Tools can help you achieve those goals, and where we might need help from our fellow humans or where we need to put our nose to the grindstone, roll up our sleeves and any other metaphor for “sit down on our tuchus and do it” that comes to mind.

7: Using AI Tools for our ILPs

1. Let’s work on our independent learning plans, go through some of our goals and decide on what tools we would like to use to achieve that goal
2. Let’s discuss what was challenging, rewarding, difficult or straightforward about this process so far: what has been different from other courses, what has been similar
3. What questions or concerns might you have about the Independent Learning Plans?
4. Let’s take time to go through these issues together and work on our ILP’s further.

8-9: Using AI Tools for our LinkedIn Profiles

Plan for Today:

* Go to LinkedIn and Google/Gemini and log in. 
* Compose 2 distinct multiline prompts for Gemini (or another LLM of your choice) toward creating either a personal statement for your LinkedIn or another professional, public facing text (Cover Letter, etc.). Be sure to include the 3 features we discussed last time in your multiline prompts:
  * Remember, LLM’s are not search engines, getting good responses often means adding some additional sentences of explanation and preference to your instruction or query. (We want to avoid using one line prompts until you get a hang of how these things work, and when they don’t work, if you are not sure if these factors help, do an experiment in two different Gemini windows, one with the following and one without!).
  * Context: What is your why and for whom and other w’s? (is this for a company? where will this be shown? who do you want to reach?)
  * Format: how should your response be structured? Are you looking for a bullet point list that you flush out? Are you looking for a list of questions that you might answer in your profile? Are you looking for a draft of a cover-letter from a job description or series of points that you are already looking at?
  * Tone: how do you want your response and to sound? Do you want a more upbeat, humorous message? Perhaps something more professional or even academic? What level of formality or diction would you like to use? How do you want your reader to feel after reading the response (or your edits to your response)
* Have fun!

An Example of what we did in class below: 

What are we trying to write? A coverletter
What help are we trying to get from the chatbot? We would like a draft of a coverletter
What information do we need to give the chatbot to do its task? 
 Tone: We would like the tone to be professional but with words that are not too full of jargon, or corporate sounding. In the end, we want this coverletter to be friendly and approachable. 
 Format: We would like this draft to be at least 3 paragraphs, with a general introduction connecting our experience to the role, a main body describing some key aspects of our experience in more detail (and how those relate to the job description), and a conclusion that emphasizes our appreciation and excitement for the role.
 Context: What information would someone (or something, including an ai Chatbot) need to be able to complete this task?
I would need to give it a list of experiences (with job titles and descriptions) that I have had, as well as a few achievements or projects that I am proud of.
Job Description: either from the employer or summarized by you (perhaps you can even include a document with that information on it!) You could give the text of the advertisement (Links usually wont work on these things for reasons we will talk about, so lets think of it as copy-paste for now). 
Why you would be a good fit for the job...

Address and specific contact details of employer (salutation, other technical parts of letter)

10-11: Discussing Prompts and Outputs

Reflections

1. What did you find challenging or rewarding about writing your prompt? 
2. When you input the same prompt into each LLM that we are using in class (Gemini, Claude, Copilot, OpenAI etc.) what do you find happens? What are some similarities and differences between the responses?
3. In terms of Tone, Format, and Context, what do you notice about the responses? Is every component addressed?
4. How do these responses compare to the 1-line or search-query responses you’ve tried?
5. What are some questions or concerns you might have about these tools?

Next Steps

1. Read through the responses of each AI and compile them into a document (with each source labeled for your future reference). Be sure to save your document in Onedrive so you can access it later!
2. Either edit an individual response so that it is closer to what you would like to use, or go back and forth with the LLM a bit to see how it can change and edit things for you.
3. Once you have a text you are happy with as a basis, go through line by line and check whether there are any factual or tone errors. Remember, the LLM doesn’t “understand” what is real, it just sounds like it does!
4. Assuming your prompt deals with your LinkedIn Profile or other ILP oriented project, integrate it into whatever you are working on!
5. Think through your next steps for working on your LinkedIn profile and ILP. What prompts might you use to have some starter text that you find useful?

12 (After Break): Using and Exploring LinkedIn Learning

Welcome back from break! For today we will be exploring LinkedIn Learning and connecting what we have learned about prompts and AI to our LinkedIn profiles.

1. Please sign into LinkedIn and navigate to LinkedInLearning (Should be the button on the upper right of the page) and click this Link to navigate to our learning plan
2. Have a look around! What courses might be interesting to you? Let’s think about what each of your independent learning plans might be for the next few months as we move into applying what we have learned about Prompts to various AI tools.
3. Toward the end of our session, let’s reflect on what we have done so far and what you would like to accomplish over the next few weeks individually. If you are up for it, have a look at the Independent Learning Plan Template. 
4. Have a look at this video over the next week! Feel free to pause and ponder, rewatch parts that don’t make sense or note your questions for class! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPZh9BOjkQs

13: Using LinkedIn and AI for our Independent Learning Plans

Today’s Plan: please sign into LinkedIn Learning with your College Email and click on this link to be able to join the learning plan discussed previously.

After looking through some of the courses and material on offer, let us attempt to answer the following questions:

  1. What goals do I have for the remainder of this year?

  2. What courses pique my interest? (Try to find 3-5 of varying lengths and intensity.)

  3. What concrete project (see your Independent Learning Plan) might I use as a way of framing my learning of the material in those courses?

At home this week: Please work on your independent learning plan and be ready to discuss what you would like to work on and produce over the next 10 weeks. Note that this can of course be connected to your other courses, your personal or professional goals, or just a fun project.

14: Independent Learning Plan Review

Today we will look at the progress you have made on your independent learning plan and see how we can incorporate LinkedIn Learning into the coming weeks after break.

15-16: Project Work

Your Project, which hopefully serves your broader goals, will be due for review in early May during which we can discuss the challenges you faced, how you overcame those challenges, what you have learned over the course of the year and what your plans are moving forward.

17: Review, Plan for March, Next Steps

Today will be a bit of review of some of the concepts and methods we have discussed as well as an overview of what we will tackle in March. To close we will discuss our Independent Learning Plans and set due-dates and review dates for various portions of our project.

Review:

* Different boxes, different skills: how different tools, search, chatbots, and more, use and respond to our words differently
* 3 Parts of a Prompt: 
* Prompts and Queries across different tools:

Plan for March:

Week 1: Principles of AI Literacy

Week 2: Check-In and Editing

Week 3: St Patrick’s Day (Feedback during the week via email/teams if requested)

Week 4: Presentation of Work (15 Minutes each)

First Monday of April: Reflection

Independent Learning Plans:

Planning: What do you want to accomplish, how does that help meet your other professional and personal goals? (See the forms we have used above, or use your own document! :) ) How will you know you are finished? (Only condition is that you use AI tools to solve a problem where you can evaluate the outcome of your investigations)

Structure: What structure will allow you to best compare and contrast various tools? How will you assess responses or outcomes of your experiments?

Reflection: Doing something is a great first step (or, hopefully, second after planning). Reflection is what allows us to learn from the experiences we gathered during that doing! In addition to your submission to me, and a brief presentation discussing your work, we will each write a brief reflection on our experiences with this project. Note that there will be other opportunities to give feedback about the class as a whole!

Early Stuff (Outdated)

Today, as usual, we have a couple options of the work we will do today.

1. There is (hopefully) a printed version of this practice sheet (from the same place as the informal self-assessment we discussed last week) which you can work on and after you have done 8 or so questions, check your work with the answer key and we can discuss what was difficult or caused you some trouble.
2. Create three to five problems or questions on any of the following topics with increasing difficulty, on the back of your paper (or on a separate page) write out solutions to each problem you created as well as what makes the problem tricky—what does the problem test?
  1. Frac/tion - Arith/metic
  2. Converting between .Decimals, Frac/tions and Percents %
  3. Working with Exponents/Powers (positive exponents, negative exponents, dividing and multiplying and adding them...)
  4. Working with fractional exponents, square roots, etc.
  5. Operations on Polynomials (Simplify (-3x^2+ 3x) + (4x^2 - x/2 ), think of addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.)
  6. Factoring Polynomials
  7. Working with Logarithms (general operations, conversions)
  8. Sketching and graphing functions and polynomials (lines, parabolas, and more! 
  9. Exponential and logarithmic Functions (graphing, interpreting, simplifying)
  10. Derivative Rules (derivatives of polynomials, operations with derivatives, combinations of derivatives, chain rule)
  11. Integration Rules (integrating polynomials, u substitution, chain rule)
  12. Trigonometric functions (Sine, cosine, tangent, etc.)
  13. Operations with complex numbers (i, sqrt(-1))
  14. Functions (or trigonometric functions) with complex numbers (e^ix, factoring and graphing (x^4 + 1)
3. This link will take you to a form where you will be asked to create an independent learning plan based on some of the topics we discussed last time as causing some trouble. For more on Independent Learning Plans, check out this page!
4. If you would prefer to work on eomsething else more independently, you can work on Khan Academy (the class code can be found here if you choose to make an account, but you don’t need one to do exercises) or another resource that you have discussed with me.

Assignment Directions

Hey there, future game developers! 😄 In this informal assignment, you'll be creating the magic behind a text-based game map. Imagine a world where you define the coordinates, measure distances, set dimensions, and add exciting points of interest. Plus, you'll sprinkle in some flavour text and make the map interactive for users! If you'd like to create a visual map using an image, ASCII art, or some other visual representation, that's great! Let me know, and I'll help figure out a way that works given your level! 😊 Note, this assignment will not be graded, it is designed to give you a chance to break down a big problem into smaller chunks and try out some of what you have learned so far. Next week we will go through some of the ideas that various folks have come up with, give some informal feedback, and celebrate your progress. Ready to dive in? Let's go!

Steps to Consider:

1. Define the Coordinate System: You will likely need to create a function to establish a coordinate system for your map. This could be a grid or any other system that fits your awesome design. Think about what kind of data structure (e.g., lists, tuples) would best represent your coordinates.

2. Measure Distances: See if you can write a function to calculate the distance between two points on your map. You might want to use Euclidean distance or another method that works for you like Manhattan distance if you are using a city-grid. Consider whether you need floats or integers for your calculations.

3. Set Dimensions and Scale: Try to develop functions to set the dimensions and scale of your map. Decide how large your map will be and how distances will be represented. Perhaps write a function that checks whether a given point of interest (or the player) is on the map. Think about what data structure might best store map dimensions and scale. Note that this could literally just be variables that declare the size of the map, or a function that allows you to change the map size (might be a 3 liner!). For units and scale (like meters or km)  that might only really come up if you are printing things for the user, or are somehow scaling in and out (we can talk about scaling as that's a fun one!)

4. Add Points of Interest: Perhaps you would find it interesting to create a function to add points of interest to your map. These could be locations, landmarks, or other cool spots that make your map unique. How will you represent their position? How will you represent their names? Are there other features or categories you would like to use? What kind of data structure might be helpful here? Lists or dictionaries could be very useful.

Comments are Help for Present and Future You: Make sure to comment on nearly every line of code. Comments serve as a way to remind yourself of your intentions for each line and to explain your code to others who may read it. This practice is essential for clear and maintainable code.

Some things that might be fun to add: 

* Incorporate Flavor Text: If your map is set in a specific place, whether fictional or real, see if you can find opportunities to include descriptive text for different areas of your map. This will enhance the narrative and make the user experience more immersive. Strings will be essential here.
* Provide Directions: While certainly not required, it might be fun to implement a function to give directions from one point to another on the map. This could involve simple cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) or more detailed instructions. How might you implement or depict roads? Can you do so with just text or do you prefer a visual approach? Think about how you might represent these directions: how might they be calculated or shown to the user?
* Enable User Interaction: You are welcome to just have the user interact with the functions that allow users to interact with the map. This could include moving to different points, examining locations, or other interactive elements. Consider what data structures will make user interactions efficient and intuitive.

Remember, if you need help with loops, classes, or Python function definitions, I'm here to assist you. Let's create something amazing together! 🚀

Learning C#

Primary and Alternative Learning Paths:

What are our primary and alternative learning paths?

Our primary learning path will involve a specific series of materials as well as practice problems to be learned and digested both in and out of class. Learning to program is a significant time commitment, and learning how one learns is an added, but essential, component to learning. In our classes we will have the structure outlined below, but this structure might not work for everyone. That is why we have an alternative learning path: this learning path is based more on individual goals and alternative resources: there will still be the responsibility of completing and submitting assignments, just as I will still be available to help with coding questions and any misunderstandings and conceptual struggles that may arise. There is no negative repercussion from engaging in alternative methods of learning in my class, however, if you find yourself struggling with your chosen method and resources, it is your responsibility to discuss concerns with me, and to seek out alternative means of learning the material we need to cover. With that in mind:

visual-map-tutorial

Visual Map Tutorial: A Gentle Introduction to OOP

This tutorial introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through a simple, visual map application. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand basic OOP concepts and how they work together to create a functional program.

What You’ll Build

We’re creating a simple application that:

* Displays a background map image
* Shows a marker that can be moved around the map
* Allows movement using arrow keys or buttons
* Prevents the marker from moving outside the map boundaries

The Three Core Classes

Our program consists of just three classes, each with a specific responsibility:

1. GameMap - Handles the background image and map properties
2. Marker - Represents the movable marker on the map
3. MapApp - Manages the user interface and connects everything

This separation of concerns is a fundamental principle in OOP. Instead of writing one giant block of code, we organize related functionality into classes.

Understanding the GameMap Class

The GameMap class represents the background map. Let’s look at its responsibilities:

class GameMap:
    """
    The GameMap class represents a visual map that can be displayed.
    It handles loading the background image and keeping track of map dimensions.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, image_path, width=800, height=600):
        # Store the map dimensions
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        
        # Store the image path for later use
        self.image_path = image_path
        
        # Load the image
        self.load_image()

Key OOP Concepts in GameMap

1. Class Definition:
  * We define a blueprint for creating map objects
  * Each map will have the same structure but can have different images and dimensions
2. Constructor Method (__init__):
  * This special method is called when a new GameMap object is created
  * It initializes the object’s attributes with the provided values
  * The self parameter refers to the specific instance being created
3. Instance Attributes:
  * self.width, self.height, and self.image_path are unique to each GameMap instance
  * These represent the object’s state (data)
4. Instance Methods:
  * Functions like load_image() and is_valid_position() define the object’s behavior
  * They operate on the object’s data through the self parameter

The Marker Class

The Marker class represents the movable marker on the map:

class Marker:
    """
    The Marker class represents a movable marker on the map.
    It keeps track of its position and appearance.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, x, y, step_size=20, marker_image_path=None):
        # Store position coordinates
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        
        # Store the step size (how far the marker moves in one step)
        self.step_size = step_size
        
        # Store the marker image path
        self.marker_image_path = marker_image_path
        self.image = None
        
        # Load the marker image if specified
        if marker_image_path:
            self.load_image()

Key OOP Concepts in Marker

1. Encapsulation:
  * The marker’s position (x and y) and other properties are bundled together
  * Methods like move() operate on this encapsulated data
  * The class provides a clean interface for interacting with the marker
2. Behavior and Data Together:
  * The move() method demonstrates how an object combines behavior with data
  * It checks if a move is valid and updates the position if it is
3. Object Collaboration:
  * The move() method takes a game_map parameter, showing how objects can work together
  * The marker asks the map if a position is valid before moving

The MapApp Class - Bringing It All Together

The MapApp class demonstrates how objects can be composed together to build a complete application:

class MapApp:
    """
    The MapApp class brings everything together to create an interactive map application.
    It handles the GUI, user input, and coordinates between the map and marker.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, root, map_image_path, marker_image_path=None):
        # ... setup code ...
        
        # Create the map
        self.game_map = GameMap(map_image_path)
        
        # Create the marker in the center of the map
        center_x = self.game_map.width // 2
        center_y = self.game_map.height // 2
        self.marker = Marker(center_x, center_y, marker_image_path=marker_image_path)

Key OOP Concepts in MapApp

1. Composition:
  * MapApp contains a GameMap and a Marker
  * This “has-a” relationship is a powerful way to build complex systems from simpler parts
2. Separation of Concerns:
  * Each class has a specific responsibility
  * MapApp handles the user interface
  * GameMap manages the background and its properties
  * Marker manages its position and movement logic
3. Delegation:
  * MapApp delegates tasks to its component objects
  * For example, it asks the marker to move, then updates the display

Running the Application

To run the application, you need:

1. A folder named images with:
  * A map image (e.g., fantasy_map.jpg)
  * A marker image (e.g., marker.png)
2. Run the program:

python map_app.py

1. Use arrow keys or the buttons to move the marker around the map.

Common Questions

What makes this code “object-oriented”?

The code is organized around objects (GameMap, Marker, MapApp) rather than just functions. Each object encapsulates related data and behavior together.

Why use multiple classes instead of one big class?

By separating functionality into distinct classes, we create more maintainable and reusable code. Each class has a clear responsibility, making the code easier to understand and extend.

How does this improve code reuse?

You could easily reuse the GameMap or Marker classes in other projects. For example, the Marker could be used in any application that needs a movable element.

Extending the Program

Try these modifications to enhance your understanding:

1. Add a simple “treasure” that appears at random locations on the map
2. Create a “SpecialMarker” class that extends Marker with new abilities
3. Add the ability to change the map background
4. Implement a “fog of war” effect that reveals the map as the marker moves

Remember, OOP is about creating modular, reusable components that can be combined and extended to build complex systems!

Interactive Map: A Visual Introduction to OOP

This Jupyter notebook introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through a simple visual map application. We’ll build a program that displays a map image with a movable marker, demonstrating fundamental OOP concepts in a way that’s easy to understand and experiment with.

1. Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code around “objects” - entities that contain both data (attributes) and code (methods). This approach helps us model real-world systems and create more maintainable, reusable code.

In this notebook, we’ll create three classes:

1. GameMap - Handles the background map image
2. Marker - Represents the movable marker on the map
3. MapApp - Brings everything together into an interactive application

2. Setting Up Our Environment

First, let’s import the libraries we need:

import tkinter as tk
from PIL import Image, ImageTk
import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from IPython.display import display
from ipywidgets import Button, HBox, VBox, Output

3. The GameMap Class

Our first class represents the map itself:

class GameMap:
    """
    The GameMap class represents a visual map that can be displayed.
    It handles loading the background image and keeping track of map dimensions.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, image_path, width=800, height=600):
        """
        Initialize a new map with the given background image.
        
        Args:
            image_path: Path to the background image file
            width: Width to display the image (default 800)
            height: Height to display the image (default 600)
        """
        # Store the map dimensions
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        
        # Store the image path for later use
        self.image_path = image_path
        
        # Load the image (we'll resize it when displaying)
        self.load_image()
    
    def load_image(self):
        """Load the map's background image from the file."""
        try:
            # Check if the image file exists
            if not os.path.exists(self.image_path):
                raise FileNotFoundError(f"Map image not found: {self.image_path}")
            
            # PIL is used to open and resize the image
            self.original_image = Image.open(self.image_path)
            
            # Get the actual dimensions of the original image
            self.original_width, self.original_height = self.original_image.size
            
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error loading map image: {e}")
            # Create a blank image as a fallback
            self.original_image = Image.new('RGB', (self.width, self.height), color='lightgray')
            self.original_width, self.original_height = self.width, self.height
    
    def is_valid_position(self, x, y):
        """
        Check if a position is valid (within the map boundaries).
        
        Args:
            x: X coordinate to check
            y: Y coordinate to check
            
        Returns:
            True if the position is valid, False otherwise
        """
        return 0 <= x < self.width and 0 <= y < self.height
    
    def display(self):
        """Display the map image using matplotlib."""
        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
        plt.imshow(self.original_image)
        plt.axis('off')
        plt.title("Game Map")
        plt.show()

Let’s create an instance of our GameMap class and display it:

# Create a map (replace with your actual image path)
map_path = "map_image.jpg"  # Update this path to your image

# If the file doesn't exist, we'll use an example image
if not os.path.exists(map_path):
    # Create a simple colored rectangle as a demonstration map
    demo_map = Image.new('RGB', (800, 600), color='lightblue')
    
    # Add some simple terrain features
    import random
    from PIL import ImageDraw
    
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(demo_map)
    
    # Add some "mountains"
    for _ in range(20):
        x = random.randint(0, 800)
        y = random.randint(0, 600)
        size = random.randint(30, 80)
        draw.polygon([(x, y), (x-size//2, y+size), (x+size//2, y+size)], fill='brown')
    
    # Add some "water"
    for _ in range(5):
        x = random.randint(100, 700)
        y = random.randint(100, 500)
        size = random.randint(50, 150)
        draw.ellipse((x-size//2, y-size//4, x+size//2, y+size//4), fill='blue')
    
    # Add some "forests"
    for _ in range(15):
        x = random.randint(0, 800)
        y = random.randint(0, 600)
        size = random.randint(40, 100)
        draw.ellipse((x-size//2, y-size//2, x+size//2, y+size//2), fill='darkgreen')
    
    # Save the demo map
    map_path = "demo_map.jpg"
    demo_map.save(map_path)

# Now create our map
game_map = GameMap(map_path)

4. The Marker Class

Now, let’s create a class to represent our movable marker:

class Marker:
    """
    The Marker class represents a movable marker on the map.
    It keeps track of its position and appearance.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, x, y, step_size=20, marker_image_path=None):
        """
        Initialize a new marker at the given position.
        
        Args:
            x: Initial X coordinate
            y: Initial Y coordinate
            step_size: Number of pixels to move in each step
            marker_image_path: Optional path to an image to use as the marker
        """
        # Store position coordinates
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        
        # Store the step size (how far the marker moves in one step)
        self.step_size = step_size
        
        # Store the marker image path
        self.marker_image_path = marker_image_path
        self.image = None
        
        # Load the marker image if specified
        if marker_image_path and os.path.exists(marker_image_path):
            self.load_image()
        else:
            # Create a simple default marker
            self.create_default_image()
    
    def load_image(self):
        """Load the marker's image from the file."""
        try:
            # Open the image
            self.image = Image.open(self.marker_image_path)
            
            # Resize to a reasonable size for a marker (e.g., 40x40 pixels)
            self.image = self.image.resize((40, 40), Image.LANCZOS)
            
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error loading marker image: {e}")
            self.create_default_image()
    
    def create_default_image(self):
        """Create a default marker image (a red circle)."""
        # Create a small image with a red circle
        size = 40
        self.image = Image.new('RGBA', (size, size), (0, 0, 0, 0))
        from PIL import ImageDraw
        draw = ImageDraw.Draw(self.image)
        draw.ellipse((5, 5, size-5, size-5), fill='red', outline='black')
    
    def move(self, direction, game_map):
        """
        Move the marker in the specified direction if the new position is valid.
        
        Args:
            direction: String indicating direction ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right')
            game_map: GameMap object to check for valid positions
            
        Returns:
            True if the move was successful, False otherwise
        """
        # Calculate the new position based on the direction
        new_x, new_y = self.x, self.y
        
        if direction == 'up':
            new_y -= self.step_size
        elif direction == 'down':
            new_y += self.step_size
        elif direction == 'left':
            new_x -= self.step_size
        elif direction == 'right':
            new_x += self.step_size
        else:
            print(f"Unknown direction: {direction}")
            return False
        
        # Check if the new position is valid
        if game_map.is_valid_position(new_x, new_y):
            # Update the marker's position
            self.x, self.y = new_x, new_y
            return True
        else:
            print(f"Cannot move {direction} - that would be outside the map.")
            return False
    
    def get_position(self):
        """Return the current position of the marker."""
        return (self.x, self.y)

Let’s create a marker and test it:

# Create a marker in the center of the map
center_x = game_map.width // 2
center_y = game_map.height // 2
marker = Marker(center_x, center_y)

# Let's test moving it
print(f"Starting position: ({marker.x}, {marker.y})")
marker.move('right', game_map)
print(f"After moving right: ({marker.x}, {marker.y})")
marker.move('down', game_map)
print(f"After moving down: ({marker.x}, {marker.y})")

5. Bringing It All Together - The MapApp Class for Jupyter

To make our map interactive in Jupyter, we’ll adapt our MapApp class to work with ipywidgets and matplotlib:

class JupyterMapApp:
    """
    A version of MapApp designed to work in Jupyter notebooks.
    Uses ipywidgets and matplotlib instead of tkinter.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, map_image_path, marker_image_path=None):
        """Initialize the map application."""
        # Create the map
        self.game_map = GameMap(map_image_path)
        
        # Create the marker in the center of the map
        center_x = self.game_map.width // 2
        center_y = self.game_map.height // 2
        self.marker = Marker(center_x, center_y, marker_image_path=marker_image_path)
        
        # Create output area for the map
        self.output = Output()
        
        # Create control buttons
        self.create_control_buttons()
        
        # Initial drawing of the map and marker
        self.update_display()
    
    def create_control_buttons(self):
        """Create buttons for controlling the marker's movement."""
        # Create movement buttons
        self.up_button = Button(description="Up")
        self.down_button = Button(description="Down")
        self.left_button = Button(description="Left")
        self.right_button = Button(description="Right")
        
        # Add button click handlers
        self.up_button.on_click(lambda b: self.move_marker('up'))
        self.down_button.on_click(lambda b: self.move_marker('down'))
        self.left_button.on_click(lambda b: self.move_marker('left'))
        self.right_button.on_click(lambda b: self.move_marker('right'))
        
        # Arrange buttons in a layout
        self.button_layout = VBox([
            HBox([None, self.up_button, None]),
            HBox([self.left_button, None, self.right_button]),
            HBox([None, self.down_button, None])
        ])
    
    def move_marker(self, direction):
        """Move the marker in the specified direction and update the display."""
        if self.marker.move(direction, self.game_map):
            self.update_display()
    
    def update_display(self):
        """Redraw the map and marker."""
        with self.output:
            # Clear the output
            self.output.clear_output(wait=True)
            
            # Create a copy of the map image
            display_img = self.game_map.original_image.copy()
            
            # Draw the marker on the map
            marker_x = int(self.marker.x * self.game_map.original_width / self.game_map.width)
            marker_y = int(self.marker.y * self.game_map.original_height / self.game_map.height)
            
            # Calculate marker position for pasting
            paste_x = marker_x - self.marker.image.width // 2
            paste_y = marker_y - self.marker.image.height // 2
            
            # Paste the marker onto the map (this handles transparency if the marker has an alpha channel)
            if self.marker.image.mode == 'RGBA':
                display_img.paste(self.marker.image, (paste_x, paste_y), self.marker.image)
            else:
                display_img.paste(self.marker.image, (paste_x, paste_y))
            
            # Display the combined image
            plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
            plt.imshow(display_img)
            plt.axis('off')
            plt.title(f"Game Map - Marker at ({self.marker.x}, {self.marker.y})")
            plt.show()
    
    def display(self):
        """Display the map application with controls."""
        display(VBox([self.output, self.button_layout]))

6. Let’s Run Our Interactive Map!

Now let’s create and run our complete map application:

# Create our map application
map_path = "demo_map.jpg"  # Using our demo map from earlier

# Create a simple marker if you don't have one
marker_path = "marker.png"
if not os.path.exists(marker_path):
    marker_img = Image.new('RGBA', (40, 40), (0, 0, 0, 0))
    from PIL import ImageDraw
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(marker_img)
    draw.ellipse((5, 5, 35, 35), fill='red', outline='black')
    marker_img.save(marker_path)

# Create and display the app
app = JupyterMapApp(map_path, marker_path)
app.display()

7. Understanding OOP Concepts Through Our Map Application

Now let’s explore the key OOP concepts demonstrated in our code:

Classes and Objects

A class is like a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of an object. In our code, GameMap, Marker, and JupyterMapApp are classes.

An object is an instance of a class. For example, we created a specific game map object when we called GameMap(map_path).

# This is a class definition
class GameMap:
    # Class code here...

# This creates an object (an instance of the class)
my_map = GameMap("path/to/image.jpg")

Constructors

The __init__ method is a special method called when an object is created. It initializes the object’s attributes:

def __init__(self, image_path, width=800, height=600):
    # Initialize attributes
    self.width = width
    self.height = height
    self.image_path = image_path

Encapsulation

Encapsulation means bundling data (attributes) and methods that work on that data together in a class:

class Marker:
    def __init__(self, x, y, step_size=20):
        # Data
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.step_size = step_size
    
    def move(self, direction, game_map):
        # Method that works with the data
        # Calculate new position and update if valid

Object Collaboration

Objects can interact with each other by passing them as arguments to methods:

# The Marker's move method needs a GameMap to check if the move is valid
if marker.move('right', game_map):
    print("Moved successfully!")

Composition

Building complex objects by combining simpler ones:

class JupyterMapApp:
    def __init__(self, map_image_path, marker_image_path=None):
        # The app is composed of a GameMap and a Marker
        self.game_map = GameMap(map_image_path)
        self.marker = Marker(center_x, center_y, marker_image_path=marker_image_path)

8. Exercises to Try

Now that you understand the basics, try these exercises to deepen your understanding:

1. Modify the marker to move in diagonal directions (e.g., ‘up-right’, ‘down-left’).
2. Add multiple markers to the map, each with a different color.
3. Create a “Treasure” class that appears at random locations on the map.
4. Add a counter that tracks how many steps the marker has moved.
5. Implement a boundary around the edges of the map (like a wall) that the marker cannot cross.

9. Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve built a simple but functional object-oriented program. The visual nature of this example helps make abstract OOP concepts more concrete and understandable.

Key takeaways:

* Classes are blueprints for objects
* Objects combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods)
* Objects can work together to create complex systems
* Complex objects can be built by combining simpler ones

As you continue learning, you’ll discover more advanced OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, which build on these foundations.
Solar System OOP 1 of 3

Solar System Explorer: A Whimsical Journey Through OOP

Part 1: Managing Solar System Locations with Basic Data Structures

Let’s start by creating a simple solar system explorer that tracks three types of locations: planets, moons, and space stations. We’ll implement a travel system that allows journeys between these celestial bodies.

First, let’s see how we might approach this using basic C# data structures:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create lists of locations by type
        List<Dictionary<string, object>> planets = new List<Dictionary<string, object>>
        {
            new Dictionary<string, object>
            {
                {"name", "Mars"}, 
                {"distanceFromSun", 227.9}, 
                {"hasRings", false}, 
                {"funFact", "Home to Olympus Mons, the tallest mountain in the solar system!"}
            },
            new Dictionary<string, object>
            {
                {"name", "Saturn"}, 
                {"distanceFromSun", 1433.5}, 
                {"hasRings", true}, 
                {"funFact", "Its rings would make a fabulous hula hoop for a giant!"}
            }
        };

        List<Dictionary<string, object>> moons = new List<Dictionary<string, object>>
        {
            new Dictionary<string, object>
            {
                {"name", "Europa"}, 
                {"parentPlanet", "Jupiter"}, 
                {"hasWater", true}, 
                {"funFact", "Has an ocean under its icy crust where space fish might be doing the backstroke!"}
            },
            new Dictionary<string, object>
            {
                {"name", "Titan"}, 
                {"parentPlanet", "Saturn"}, 
                {"hasWater", false}, 
                {"funFact", "Has lakes of liquid methane! Not recommended for skinny dipping."}
            }
        };

        List<Dictionary<string, object>> spaceStations = new List<Dictionary<string, object>>
        {
            new Dictionary<string, object>
            {
                {"name", "ISS"}, 
                {"orbitingBody", "Earth"}, 
                {"crewCapacity", 7}, 
                {"funFact", "Astronauts see 16 sunrises every day! Talk about needing coffee."}
            },
            new Dictionary<string, object>
            {
                {"name", "Lunar Gateway"}, 
                {"orbitingBody", "Moon"}, 
                {"crewCapacity", 4}, 
                {"funFact", "Future lunar outpost where astronauts will practice their moon walks!"}
            }
        };

        // Track current location of our explorer
        Dictionary<string, object> currentLocation = planets[0]; // Start on Mars
        string currentLocationType = "planet";

        Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the Solar System Explorer 1.0!");
        Console.WriteLine($"You are currently on {currentLocation["name"]}, a {currentLocationType}.");
        Console.WriteLine($"Fun fact: {currentLocation["funFact"]}");

        // Try traveling to another location
        TravelTo("Titan", currentLocation, currentLocationType, planets, moons, spaceStations);
        
        // Imagine a menu system here to keep traveling to different locations...
    }

    static void TravelTo(string destinationName, Dictionary<string, object> currentLocation, string currentLocationType,
                         List<Dictionary<string, object>> planets, List<Dictionary<string, object>> moons,

        Dictionary<string, object> destination = null;
        string destinationType = null;
        
        foreach (var planet in planets)
        {
            if ((string)planet["name"] == destinationName)
            {
                destination = planet;

        }
        
        if (destination == null)
        {
            foreach (var station in spaceStations)
            {
                if ((string)station["name"] == destinationName)
                {
                    destination = station;
                    destinationType = "space station";
                    break;

        {
            Console.WriteLine("Planet to moon travel: Reducing thrusters as we approach this smaller celestial body!");
        }
        else if (currentLocationType == "moon" && destinationType == "planet")

    }

    static void DisplayAllLocations(List<Dictionary<string, object>> planets, 
                                   List<Dictionary<string, object>> moons,

        foreach (var planet in planets)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  - {planet["name"]} ({planet["distanceFromSun"]} million km from Sun)");
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine("\nMoons:");
        foreach (var moon in moons)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  - {moon["name"]} (Orbits: {moon["parentPlanet"]})");
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine("\nSpace Stations:");
        foreach (var station in spaceStations)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"  - {station["name"]} (Orbits: {station["orbitingBody"]}, Crew: {station["crewCapacity"]})");
        }
    }
}

Limitations of the Basic Approach

While our solar system explorer technically works, it has several major problems that would make NASA mission control cringe:

1. Repetitive Code: We need separate loops to find a location, and this gets unmanageable as we add more location types.
2. Parameter Overload: Look at all those parameters in the TravelTo function! It’s like trying to pack an entire rocket in your carry-on luggage.
3. State Management: Tracking the current location and its type separately is prone to errors. What if they get out of sync?
4. Code Organization: The travel logic is completely separated from the location data, which makes it hard to add location-specific travel rules.
5. Type Safety: We’re using strings to track types, which is about as reliable as delivering pizza to Jupiter.

Let’s improve our design with the power of OOP and blast off to a better implementation!

Part 2: Creating a Class-Based Solar System Explorer

Let’s create a proper class hierarchy for our solar system objects:

using System;

// Base class for all space locations
public abstract class CelestialLocation
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string FunFact { get; set; }
    
    public CelestialLocation(string name, string funFact)
    {
        Name = name;
        FunFact = funFact;
    }
    
    // Method to provide information about this location

Now, let’s create our SolarSystemMap class that will manage all these locations:

            }
        }
    }
}

Part 3: Benefits of the Class-Based Approach

Let’s compare our sophisticated class-based approach with the original simple implementation:

1. Clean Abstraction: The CelestialLocation base class defines the common interface for all locations.
2. Polymorphism: Each location type can implement its own arrival and departure messages.
3. Encapsulation: The travel logic is now encapsulated within the SolarSystemMap class, making it much simpler to use.
4. State Management: We’re now tracking the current location as an object reference, eliminating the possibility of type/object mismatch.
5. Extensibility: Adding new location types (like asteroids or comets) is simple and won’t require changing the TravelTo method.
6. Richer Behaviors: Each location can have specialized behaviors without cluttering the main program.

Part 4: Taking It Further

Here are some ways to extend our solar system explorer:

// Adding a travel cost system
public double CalculateTravelCost(CelestialLocation from, CelestialLocation to)
{
    // Calculate based on distance, type, etc.
    double baseCost = 100; // Base travel cost in space credits
    
    // Additional cost based on distance
    if (from is Planet fromPlanet && to is Planet toPlanet)
    {
        return baseCost * Math.Abs(fromPlanet.DistanceFromSun - toPlanet.DistanceFromSun) / 50;
    }
    
    // Different pricing for moon travel
    if (to is Moon moon)
    {
        return baseCost + (moon.HasWater ? 50 : 20); // Water moons are tourist attractions!
    }
    
    return baseCost;
}

// Adding a new location type - Asteroid
public class Asteroid : CelestialLocation
{
    public double Size { get; set; } // km diameter
    public bool IsMiningOperation { get; set; }
    
    public Asteroid(string name, double size, bool isMiningOperation, string funFact) 
        : base(name, funFact)
    {
        Size = size;
        IsMiningOperation = isMiningOperation;
    }
    
    public override string GetInfo()
    {
        string miningInfo = IsMiningOperation 
            ? "Active mining operation - watch for space trucks!" 
            : "Untapped resources await the brave prospector!";
            
        return $"{base.GetInfo()}\nSize: {Size} km diameter\n{miningInfo}";
    }
    
    public override string GetArrivalMessage()
    {
        return $"Anchoring to asteroid {Name} with gravity hooks! Remember to wear magnetic boots or you'll float away with the space dust!";
    }
    
    public override string GetDepartureMessage()
    {
        return $"Detaching from {Name}. Mind the floating debris as we exit the microgravity field!";
    }
}

// Adding weather conditions to planets
public class WeatherSystem
{
    private Random random = new Random();
    
    public string GetCurrentWeather(Planet planet)
    {
        string[] earthWeather = { "Sunny", "Rainy", "Cloudy", "Stormy", "Windy" };
        string[] gasGiantWeather = { "Mega storms", "Gas swirls", "Calm bands", "Great spots", "Electromagnetic storms" };
        string[] marsWeather = { "Dust storm", "Clear and frigid", "Light breeze", "Global dust event", "Morning frost" };
        
        if (planet.Name == "Earth")
        {
            return earthWeather[random.Next(earthWeather.Length)];
        }
        else if (planet.Name == "Mars")
        {
            return marsWeather[random.Next(marsWeather.Length)];
        }
        else if (planet.HasRings) // Assuming gas giants have rings
        {
            return gasGiantWeather[random.Next(gasGiantWeather.Length)];
        }
        
        return "Unknown atmospheric conditions";
    }
}

Conclusion

We’ve seen how to evolve from a simple approach using basic data structures to a robust object-oriented design for our solar system explorer. The class-based approach gives us:

1. Better organization - Each celestial object type knows how to handle its own behavior
2. Enhanced functionality - We can easily add rich features like specialized travel narration
3. Improved maintainability - Adding new location types doesn’t require changing existing code
4. More immersive experience - The polymorphic behavior creates a more engaging program

This example demonstrates fundamental object-oriented principles while providing a fun and whimsical way to explore our solar system. The journey from procedural to object-oriented programming is a bit like space travel itself - it requires more initial preparation, but the adventure is far more exciting and the destinations more varied!

Bon voyage, intrepid code explorer! May your classes be well-encapsulated and your inheritance hierarchies clear as the stars! 🚀✨

Solar System Explorer 2.0: Class-Based Implementation

Introduction

In this notebook, we’ll rebuild our solar system explorer using object-oriented programming principles. We’ll create a proper class hierarchy for celestial objects and implement travel in a more structured way.

Let’s see how classes can help us create a more robust and extensible solar system explorer! 🚀

#r "nuget:System.Collections"

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading;

Creating a Class Hierarchy

Let’s start by creating a base class for all celestial locations.

// Base class for all space locations
public abstract class CelestialLocation
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string FunFact { get; set; }
    
    public CelestialLocation(string name, string funFact)
    {
        Name = name;
        FunFact = funFact;
    }
    
    // Method to provide information about this location
    public virtual string GetInfo()
    {
        return $"{Name}: {FunFact}";
    }
    
    // Each location provides custom arrival messaging
    public abstract string GetArrivalMessage();
    
    // Each location provides custom departure messaging
    public abstract string GetDepartureMessage();
}

Now, let’s create classes for our three types of celestial objects. First, planets:

// Planet class
public class Planet : CelestialLocation
{
    public double DistanceFromSun { get; set; } // millions of km
    public bool HasRings { get; set; }
    
    public Planet(string name, double distanceFromSun, bool hasRings, string funFact) 
        : base(name, funFact)
    {
        DistanceFromSun = distanceFromSun;
        HasRings = hasRings;
    }
    
    public override string GetInfo()
    {
        string ringsInfo = HasRings ? "Has magnificent rings!" : "No rings, how ordinary.";
        return $"{base.GetInfo()}\nDistance from Sun: {DistanceFromSun} million km\n{ringsInfo}";
    }
    
    public override string GetArrivalMessage()
    {
        return $"Touchdown on planet {Name}! Gravity stabilizers engaged. {(HasRings ? "Wow, those rings look even better up close!" : "Clear skies for landing!")}";
    }
    
    public override string GetDepartureMessage()
    {
        return $"Blasting off from {Name}'s gravitational pull! Engaging warp speed in 3...2...1...";
    }
}

Next, let’s create our Moon class:

// Moon class
public class Moon : CelestialLocation
{
    public string ParentPlanet { get; set; }
    public bool HasWater { get; set; }
    
    public Moon(string name, string parentPlanet, bool hasWater, string funFact) 
        : base(name, funFact)
    {
        ParentPlanet = parentPlanet;
        HasWater = hasWater;
    }
    
    public override string GetInfo()
    {
        string waterInfo = HasWater ? "Contains water - potential for space swimming!" : "No water detected - bring your own beverages.";
        return $"{base.GetInfo()}\nOrbits: {ParentPlanet}\n{waterInfo}";
    }
    
    public override string GetArrivalMessage()
    {
        return $"Soft landing on {Name}, a moon of {ParentPlanet}! Reduced gravity detected - watch your step or you might accidentally do a backflip!";
    }
    
    public override string GetDepartureMessage()
    {
        return $"Gently pushing off from {Name}'s surface. The views of {ParentPlanet} from here are spectacular!";
    }
}

Finally, let’s create our SpaceStation class:

// Space Station class
public class SpaceStation : CelestialLocation
{
    public string OrbitingBody { get; set; }
    public int CrewCapacity { get; set; }
    
    public SpaceStation(string name, string orbitingBody, int crewCapacity, string funFact) 
        : base(name, funFact)
    {
        OrbitingBody = orbitingBody;
        CrewCapacity = crewCapacity;
    }
    
    public override string GetInfo()
    {
        return $"{base.GetInfo()}\nOrbits: {OrbitingBody}\nCrew Capacity: {CrewCapacity} space explorers";
    }
    
    public override string GetArrivalMessage()
    {
        return $"*Mechanical docking sounds* Connected to {Name} space station! Please wait for the airlock to pressurize and remember the artificial gravity toggle switch is on the left.";
    }
    
    public override string GetDepartureMessage()
    {
        return $"Disconnecting docking clamps from {Name}. Don't forget to wave to the crew through the portal windows!";
    }
}

Creating the SolarSystemMap Class

Now, let’s create a class that manages all our celestial locations and handles travel:

public class SolarSystemMap
{
    private List<CelestialLocation> locations;
    public CelestialLocation CurrentLocation { get; private set; }
    
    public SolarSystemMap()
    {
        locations = new List<CelestialLocation>();
    }
    
    public void AddLocation(CelestialLocation location)
    {
        locations.Add(location);
        // If this is our first location, start here
        if (locations.Count == 1)
        {
            CurrentLocation = location;
            Console.WriteLine($"Starting our adventure at {location.Name}!");
            Console.WriteLine(location.GetArrivalMessage());
            Console.WriteLine($"Fun Fact: {location.FunFact}");
        }
    }
    
    public void DisplayAllLocations()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n🌌 Solar System Map: All Known Locations 🌌");
        
        var planets = locations.OfType<Planet>().ToList();
        var moons = locations.OfType<Moon>().ToList();

Let’s Create Our Solar System and Try It Out!

Now let’s populate our solar system and start exploring:

// Create our solar system map
SolarSystemMap solarSystem = new SolarSystemMap();

Console.WriteLine("🚀 Welcome to Solar System Explorer 2.0! 🚀");
Console.WriteLine("Preparing for your interstellar adventure...\n");

// Add planets
solarSystem.AddLocation(new Planet("Mars", 227.9, false, 
    "Home to Olympus Mons, the tallest mountain in the solar system!"));
solarSystem.AddLocation(new Planet("Saturn", 1433.5, true, 
    "Its rings would make a fabulous hula hoop for a giant!"));
solarSystem.AddLocation(new Planet("Earth", 149.6, false, 
    "The only planet known to have chocolate cake. Coincidence? I think not."));

// Add moons
solarSystem.AddLocation(new Moon("Europa", "Jupiter", true, 
    "Has an ocean under its icy crust where space fish might be doing the backstroke!"));
solarSystem.AddLocation(new Moon("Titan", "Saturn", false, 
    "Has lakes of liquid methane! Not recommended for skinny dipping."));
solarSystem.AddLocation(new Moon("Luna", "Earth", false, 
    "Earth's moon is simply called 'the Moon' which shows a severe lack of creativity."));

// Add space stations
solarSystem.AddLocation(new SpaceStation("ISS", "Earth", 7, 
    "Astronauts see 16 sunrises every day! Talk about needing coffee."));
solarSystem.AddLocation(new SpaceStation("Lunar Gateway", "Moon", 4, 
    "Future lunar outpost where astronauts will practice their moon walks!"));

// Display all locations
solarSystem.DisplayAllLocations();

Let’s test our TravelTo function:

// Travel to different locations
Console.WriteLine("\n=== TIME TO EXPLORE! ===");

// Try traveling to a moon
solarSystem.TravelTo("Europa");

// Try traveling to a space station
solarSystem.TravelTo("ISS");

// Try traveling to a planet
solarSystem.TravelTo("Saturn");

// Try traveling to a nonexistent location
solarSystem.TravelTo("Vulcan");

Benefits of the Class-Based Approach

Let’s compare our class-based approach with the original implementation:

1. Clean Abstraction: The CelestialLocation base class defines the common interface for all locations.
2. Polymorphism: Each location type can implement its own arrival and departure messages.
3. Encapsulation: The travel logic is now encapsulated within the SolarSystemMap class.
4. State Management: We’re now tracking the current location as an object reference, eliminating the possibility of type/object mismatch.
5. Extensibility: Adding new location types is simple and won’t require changing the TravelTo method.
6. Type Safety: We use actual types instead of string representations.

Student Exercises

1. Add a new celestial object type (e.g., AsteroidBelt)
2. Implement a search function to find all locations that orbit a specific body
3. Add a “fuel” system to limit how far you can travel without refueling
4. Create a method to calculate the distance between two locations
5. Implement a feature that shows nearby locations from your current position

Solar System Explorer 3.0: Advanced Extensions

Introduction

In this notebook, we’ll build upon our class-based solar system explorer by adding advanced features and new celestial object types. These extensions demonstrate how easily an object-oriented design can be expanded.

Let’s enhance our cosmic adventure! 🚀✨

#r "nuget:System.Collections"

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

Getting Started

First, let’s include our base classes from the previous notebook:

// Base class for all space locations
public abstract class CelestialLocation
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string FunFact { get; set; }
    
    public CelestialLocation(string name, string funFact)

    public abstract string GetArrivalMessage();
    
    // Each location provides custom departure messaging
    public abstract string GetDepartureMessage();
}

// Planet class
public class Planet : CelestialLocation

        return $"{base.GetInfo()}\nOrbits: {ParentPlanet}\n{waterInfo}";
    }
    
    public override string GetArrivalMessage()
    {
        return $"Soft landing on {Name}, a moon of {ParentPlanet}! Reduced gravity detected - watch your step or you might accidentally do a backflip!";
    }
    
    public override string GetDepartureMessage()
    {
        return $"Gently pushing off from {Name}'s surface. The views of {ParentPlanet} from here are spectacular!";
    }
}

// Space Station class
public class SpaceStation : CelestialLocation

    }
    
    public override string GetArrivalMessage()
    {
        return $"*Mechanical docking sounds* Connected to {Name} space station! Please wait for the airlock to pressurize and remember the artificial gravity toggle switch is on the left.";
    }
    
    public override string GetDepartureMessage()
    {

}

// Basic SolarSystemMap class (simplified version)
public class SolarSystemMap

        // Update current location
        CurrentLocation = destination;
        return true;
    }
}

Extension 1: New Celestial Object Types

Let’s add new types of celestial objects to expand our solar system:

// Asteroid class

    }
    
    public override string GetDepartureMessage()
    {
        return $"Detaching from {Name}. Mind the floating debris as we exit the microgravity field!";
    }
}

// Black Hole class
public class BlackHole : CelestialLocation

}

// Let's test our new celestial object types
Asteroid ceres = new Asteroid("Ceres", 939, true, 
    "Largest object in the asteroid belt. Has mysterious bright spots that might be alien disco balls!");

BlackHole sagittariusA = new BlackHole("Sagittarius A*", 4.3e6, true, 
    "The supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. It's on a diet, consuming less than expected!");

Console.WriteLine("New Celestial Objects:\n");
Console.WriteLine(ceres.GetInfo());
Console.WriteLine("\nArrival at asteroid:");

Extension 3: Weather System for Planets

Let’s add a weather system that generates dynamic conditions for planets:

// Weather system for planets
public class WeatherSystem
{
    private Random random = new Random();
    private Dictionary<string, List<WeatherCondition>> planetWeather;
    
    public WeatherSystem()
    {
        planetWeather = new Dictionary<string, List<WeatherCondition>>();
        
        // Define possible weather for Earth
        planetWeather["Earth"] = new List<WeatherCondition>
        {
            new WeatherCondition("Sunny", "Clear blue skies, perfect for a spacewalk!"),
            new WeatherCondition("Rainy", "Earth's water cycle in action. Bring an umbrella!"),
            new WeatherCondition("Stormy", "Lightning makes the atmosphere sparkle. Stay inside your ship!"),
            new WeatherCondition("Cloudy", "The planet is being modest today, hiding under a fluffy blanket."),
            new WeatherCondition("Snowy", "Those white patches aren't dandruff, it's frozen precipitation!")
        };
        
        // Define possible weather for Mars
        planetWeather["Mars"] = new List<WeatherCondition>
        {
            new WeatherCondition("Dust storm", "The planet is having a bad hair day. Visibility: zero."),
            new WeatherCondition("Clear", "Enjoy the reddish landscape! Sunscreen recommended despite the distance."),
            new WeatherCondition("Windy", "Hold onto your space hat! The thin atmosphere is really moving today."),
            new WeatherCondition("Frosty", "Carbon dioxide frost glitters on the surface. It's technically dry ice!"),
            new WeatherCondition("Global dust event", "The entire planet is playing hide and seek. And winning.")
        };
        
        // Define possible weather for Saturn
        planetWeather["Saturn"] = new List<WeatherCondition>
        {
            new WeatherCondition("Ring rain", "Particles from the rings are showering down. It's cosmic precipitation!"),
            new WeatherCondition("Hexagonal storms", "The north pole's geometric weather pattern is showing off again."),
            new WeatherCondition("Gas currents", "The atmosphere is extra swirly today, like a cosmic lava lamp."),
            new WeatherCondition("Calm bands", "The cloud bands are unusually serene. Suspicious..."),
            new WeatherCondition("Auroras", "The magnetic field is putting on a light show at the poles!")
        };
    }
    
    public WeatherCondition GetCurrentWeather(string planetName)
    {
        // Return "unknown" weather if we don't have data for this planet
        if (!planetWeather.ContainsKey(planetName))
        {
            return new WeatherCondition("Unknown", "Our meteorologists are still figuring out this planet's weather patterns.");
        }
        
        // Select a random weather condition from the list for this planet
        var conditions = planetWeather[planetName];
        int index = random.Next(conditions.Count);
        return conditions[index];
    }
    
    // Add weather data for a new planet
    public void AddPlanetWeather(string planetName, List<WeatherCondition> conditions)
    {
        planetWeather[planetName] = conditions;
    }
    
    // Get a weather forecast (multiple days)
    public List<WeatherCondition> GetWeatherForecast(string planetName, int days)
    {
        List<WeatherCondition> forecast = new List<WeatherCondition>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < days; i++)
        {
            forecast.Add(GetCurrentWeather(planetName));
        }
        
        return forecast;
    }
}

// Weather condition class
public class WeatherCondition
{
    public string Condition { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    
    public WeatherCondition(string condition, string description)
    {
        Condition = condition;
        Description = description;
    }
    
    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"{Condition}: {Description}";
    }
}

// Let's test our weather system
WeatherSystem weatherSystem = new WeatherSystem();

Console.WriteLine("🌦️ Planetary Weather Report 🌦️\n");

Console.WriteLine("Earth Weather:");
var earthWeather = weatherSystem.GetCurrentWeather("Earth");
Console.WriteLine(earthWeather);

Console.WriteLine("\nMars Weather:");
var marsWeather = weatherSystem.GetCurrentWeather("Mars");
Console.WriteLine(marsWeather);

Console.WriteLine("\nSaturn Weather:");
var saturnWeather = weatherSystem.GetCurrentWeather("Saturn");
Console.WriteLine(saturnWeather);

Console.WriteLine("\n3-Day Mars Forecast:");
var marsForecast = weatherSystem.GetWeatherForecast("Mars", 3);
for (int i = 0; i < marsForecast.Count; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Day {i+1}: {marsForecast[i]}");
}

Let’s Put It All Together!

Now let’s use all of our extensions to create an advanced solar system explorer:

// Create our enhanced solar system map
EnhancedSolarSystemMap solarSystem = new EnhancedSolarSystemMap(100.0);
WeatherSystem weatherSystem = new WeatherSystem();

Console.WriteLine("🚀✨ Welcome to Solar System Explorer 3.0! ✨🚀");
Console.WriteLine("Preparing for your advanced interstellar adventure...\n");

// Add planets
solarSystem.AddLocation(new Planet("Mars", 227.9, false, 
    "Home to Olympus Mons, the tallest mountain in the solar system!"));
solarSystem.AddLocation(new Planet("Saturn", 1433.5, true, 
    "Its rings would make a fabulous hula hoop for a giant!"));
solarSystem.AddLocation(new Planet("Earth", 149.6, false, 
    "The only planet known to have chocolate cake. Coincidence? I think not."));

// Add moons
solarSystem.AddLocation(new Moon("Europa", "Jupiter", true, 
    "Has an ocean under its icy crust where space fish might be doing the backstroke!"));
solarSystem.AddLocation(new Moon("Titan", "Saturn", false, 
    "Has lakes of liquid methane! Not recommended for skinny dipping."));
solarSystem.AddLocation(new Moon("Luna", "Earth", false, 
    "Earth's moon is simply called 'the Moon' which shows a severe lack of creativity."));

// Add space stations
solarSystem.AddLocation(new SpaceStation("ISS", "Earth", 7, 
    "Astronauts see 16 sunrises every day! Talk about needing coffee."));
solarSystem.AddLocation(new SpaceStation("Lunar Gateway", "Moon", 4, 
    "Future lunar outpost where astronauts will practice their moon walks!"));

// Add our new celestial objects
solarSystem.AddLocation(new Asteroid("Ceres", 939, true, 
    "Largest object in the asteroid belt. Has mysterious bright spots that might be alien disco balls!"));
solarSystem.AddLocation(new BlackHole("Sagittarius A*", 4.3e6, true, 
    "The supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. It's on a diet, consuming less than expected!"));

// Display current location and fuel status
Console.WriteLine($"Starting our journey on {solarSystem.CurrentLocation.Name}");
Console.WriteLine($"Fuel level: {solarSystem.FuelLevel:F1} units\n");

// Check nearby locations
solarSystem.ShowNearbyLocations();

// Travel to different locations
Console.WriteLine("\n=== TIME TO EXPLORE! ===");

// Try traveling to Mars with weather report
if (solarSystem.TravelTo("Mars"))
{
    Console.WriteLine("\n🌦️ Weather Report for Mars:");
    Console.WriteLine(weatherSystem.GetCurrentWeather("Mars"));
}

// Try traveling to Saturn
if (solarSystem.TravelTo("Saturn"))
{
    Console.WriteLine("\n🌦️ Weather Report for Saturn:");
    Console.WriteLine(weatherSystem.GetCurrentWeather("Saturn"));
}

// Show nearby locations from Saturn
solarSystem.ShowNearbyLocations();

// Try traveling to Titan (moon of Saturn) - should be close
solarSystem.TravelTo("Titan");

// Low on fuel? Let's refuel
solarSystem.Refuel(50);

// Try traveling to distant black hole - should require a lot of fuel
solarSystem.TravelTo("Sagittarius A*");

// Final fuel status
Console.WriteLine($"\nFinal fuel status: {solarSystem.FuelLevel:F1} units");

Conclusion

Our solar system explorer has come a long way! We’ve seen how object-oriented programming allows us to:

1. Easily add new types - We added Asteroids and Black Holes with minimal effort
2. Extend functionality - We added travel costs, distances, and a weather system
3. Maintain a clean design - Each new feature fits neatly into our class hierarchy
4. Create rich interactions - The travel system now considers fuel, distances, and location types

These extensions demonstrate the power of object-oriented design - we can continuously expand our universe without having to rewrite existing code.

Student Exercises

1. Add a SpaceAnomaly class that has random effects when visited
2. Implement a trading system between locations
3. Add a mission system with objectives to complete
4. Create a crew management system for your spaceship
5. Implement a time system where travel takes a certain number of days depending on distance

November 3 & 10

Today we will discuss our plans for the coming 6 weeks as well as what projects and tools you might find useful 


October 20 & 27

Today we will be working on the Grants and Residences  Research Activity with an eye toward submitting a document outlining your research and reflections.


October 6 & 13

Today we will be investigating some funding, learning and travel opportunities associated with your practice. If you are not sure if you want to do these, that’s okay, learning about what is out there and figuring out what you are not interested in can be just as important as finding your thing... and who knows, you might just find something you didn’t expect! (Several artists I know have talked about residencies or grants as being what made them decide to go full time, or to change their practice to being alongside a more traditional 9-5, everyone is different, the key for us here is finding out what is out there and maybe changing our idea about what is possible or realistic.) 

Grants & Residencies Research Activity

September 29:

Plan for Today:

* Finish up Task from last week
* Group Reflection
* Communicating about Art and Process Youtube Example (part 2)
* If we have time: Discussion of Next Project (Artist Statement) Draft of Brief Communications_L6.pdf

September 22

Plan for Today:

* Recap from Last Week
* Introductory Task
* Communicating about Art and Process (A Youtube Example)

Introductory Task (1h): 

On a new word doc, let’s think through a few things involving communication with clients based on the following scenario:

A new local restaurant who you have never worked with before would like to commission your work (paintings, tableware, statue, mosaics, other endeavour relevant to your practice). 

1. What is the scope of the project? What will you be creating for them? If that has not yet been decided, how will you go about determining that?
2. How will you be billing this person? How will you ascertain pricing and budgeting?
3. What information do you need to get started on the project?  Assume you do not have the details.
4. Propose a meeting (time, day etc.) and prepare an agenda for the meeting.

Reflections on Intro Task

Looking at an Example Together:

Lets’s use the following prompts to discuss this YouTube Video together: as we watch through, see if you can address these points individually, not as general feedback or response, but specific to each question. 

* What do you notice about the tone of the speaker?
* What do you notice about the visuals, the focus, the lighting (cinematography)?
* What do you notice about how the speaker refers to themselves, to the audience?
* What emotions do you think the creator is trying to evoke in their viewers? What emotions do you actually feel? Are these the same, different?
* What do you notice about the structure of the video, of each scene?
* What vocabulary do you see the creator use, what level (or register) are they speaking in, is there a lot of jargon?
* Who do you think the primary audience is for this video? Notice how large a following this creator has, is that what you expected?

September 15

Welcome to communications! 

My name is Josh—together we will embark on an adventure in communications this year!

If you have had communications in the past, you might find that my interpretation is a bit different than your prior experiences.

What we will (broadly) cover:

* Understanding Tone and Register
* Some types of communication that might prove useful
* How we might use different modes and registers in our lives
* How we might relate to others in our professional lives to achieve our specific goals
* What new tools are available that might make various forms of communication easier (and which might make things tricky or more difficult)

How you will be assessed this year:

50% Skills Demonstrations: in class

50% Collection of Work: in and outside of class with 1:1 feedback

Next, let’s do something a bit quiet and relaxed on this Monday Morning: 

Please fill out the following form. Note, the more you type, the better I can understand your situation and tailor assignments and feedback to your specific background, circumstances and goals.

Getting to Know You as a Human Being Form.

Introductory Task: 

On a new word doc, please draft the following  scenario and then an email that outlines an initial communication with a client that has expressed interest in working with you on a creative project: 

1. What project are you working on with this person (can be real, or invented)
2. How will you be billing this person?
3. What information do you need to get started on the project?

Housekeeping:

* Attendance is highly encouraged
* Moodle is coming
* This site is where a lot of stuff will live

Our Module Descriptor

More for bookkeeping than anything, but figure you might be interested to get an overview.

6N1950 Communications v2.1 (rev) Aug 2025.pdf
Reflections on Intro Task

What were some of the emotions you felt here?

* Frustration
* Anxiety
* Self-Doubt
* Confidence
* Silliness “this isn’t a real thing anyway”
* Determination...



What are some things you noticed while writing? What was difficult, what was easy? What did you change from the beginning to the end of the process?

What would have made the exercise more useful or helpful?


Grants & Residencies Research Activity

Level 6 Art, Craft & Design

---

Overview

This activity asks you to research real funding and residency opportunities that exist for artists in Ireland and internationally. The goal is to demystify the grants landscape and help you understand what kinds of support are actually available, what they're asking for, and whether they might be right for your practice—now or in the future.

Many artists avoid applying for grants because they assume "it's not for people like me" or "I'm not experienced enough." This research will help you see the full spectrum of opportunities, from beginner-friendly to highly competitive, and understand what funders are actually looking for.

---

Why This Matters

Grants and residencies can provide:

* Time: Dedicated space to develop work without the pressure of immediate sales
* Money: Materials budgets, living stipends, or both
* Space: Access to specialized equipment, studios, or locations
* Community: Connection with other artists, mentors, or new audiences
* Legitimacy: Recognition that strengthens future applications and your CV
* Learning: Opportunities to develop new skills or techniques

Understanding how funding works—and what the strings attached actually are—is essential for building a sustainable practice. This research helps you become strategic about which opportunities to pursue and when.

---

The Task

Research grants and residency opportunities from the following categories and select THREE different opportunities that interest you. At least one should be based in Ireland, and your three selections should represent different types of opportunities (e.g., don't choose three residencies—mix it up with a project grant, a residency, and a studio award).

Research Sources

Irish National Level:

* Arts Council of Ireland / An Chomhairle Ealaíon (www.artscouncil.ie)
  * Look at: Awards, Bursaries, Project Awards, Next Generation scheme

Local Council & Libraries:

* Dublin City Council Arts Office (www.dublincity.ie/arts)
* Your own local county council (Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, South Dublin, etc.)
* Public libraries artist support programs (check individual branch programs)

Dublin Studios & Organizations:

* Fire Station Artists' Studios (firestationartiststudios.com)
* Temple Bar Gallery + Studios (templebargallery.com)
* National Sculpture Factory (Cork—for comparison)
* Visual Artists Ireland (visualartists.ie) opportunities listings
* Block T (blockt.ie)

Irish Residencies:

* Tyrone Guthrie Centre (tyroneguthrie.ie)
* The Mattress Factory (themattressfactoryartscentre.ie)
* Cill Rialaig Project (cillrialaigproject.ie)
* Cow House Studios (cowhousestudios.org)

International Residencies:

* TransArtists (transartists.org) - searchable database
* Alliance of Artists Communities (artistcommunities.org) - primarily US/Americas
* Tokyo Arts and Space (TOKAS)
* Vermont Studio Center (vermontstudiocenter.org)
* Any others you discover

---

Research Questions for Each Opportunity

For each of your three selected opportunities, answer the following questions thoroughly. These questions will help you understand not just whether you're eligible, but whether this opportunity actually serves your practice and goals.

1. Basic Information

* What is the name of the grant/residency/award?
* Who is the funding/hosting organization?
* What is the total value (money, in-kind support, etc.)?
* Application deadlines (if rolling, note that)
* Website/contact information

2. Eligibility & Experience Level

* Who is this for? (Students, emerging artists, mid-career, specific demographics?)
* What does "emerging" or "early-career" actually mean to them?
* Do you need to be a certain age?
* Do you need to be based in Ireland/EU, or can international artists apply?
* Do you need previous exhibition history? How much?
* Are there any disciplinary restrictions? (Some grants are ceramics-only, some exclude craft, etc.)

3. What They're Funding

* Is this for creating new work, or can it support existing projects?
* Is it for a single work or a body of work?
* Does it have to result in an exhibition? Public presentation? Publication?
* Can it be for research/development without a finished outcome?
* Is it about learning a new technique/skill?
* Is it about contributing to a group project or community initiative?
* Is teaching or public engagement required (workshops, talks, open studios)?

4. The Practical Details

* How long is the grant/residency period?
* Is it full-time or can you keep other work/commitments?
* If it's a residency: is accommodation provided? Meals? Travel costs?
* If it's a grant: what can the money be spent on? (Materials? Living costs? Equipment? Assistance?)
* Do you have to be in residence, or can you work from your own studio?
* What facilities/equipment are provided?

5. The Strings Attached (Read the Fine Print)

* Who owns the work you create during the grant period?
  * Do you retain full copyright?
  * Does the funder get reproduction rights?
  * Do they get to purchase work at a discount?
* Are you required to donate a work to their collection?
* What reporting is required? (Written reports? Documentation? Financial accounting?)
* Is there a public outcome required? (Exhibition, talk, open studio, publication?)
* What happens if you don't complete the project as proposed?
* Are there acknowledgment requirements? (How must you credit them?)

6. Application Requirements

* What do they want to see?
  * Written proposal? How long?
  * Portfolio of images? How many?
  * CV/resume?
  * Budget breakdown?
  * Letters of recommendation?
  * Artist statement?
* What's the selection process? (Peer review? Panel? Interview?)
* What are they actually looking for? (Read the assessment criteria carefully)
* Do they publish success rates or how many applications they typically receive?

7. Your Strategic Assessment

* Why does this opportunity interest you specifically?
* What would it allow you to do that you can't do now?
* Do you feel ready to apply now, or is this a future goal?
* What would you need to develop/prepare to make your application competitive?
* Are there any red flags or concerns?
* How does this align with your current practice and goals?

---

Deliverable Format

Create a document (can be Word, PDF, or markdown) that includes:

Introduction (100-150 words): Brief overview of your current practice and what kinds of support would be most valuable to you right now.

Three Opportunity Profiles (200-500 words each): For each opportunity, address all the research questions above in a clear, organized way. Use headers to break up sections. Write this as if you're creating a resource for your future self (or other artists).

Reflection (200-300 words):

* What surprised you in this research?
* What did you learn about how grants and residencies actually work?
* Do any of these feel accessible to you now, or are they future goals?
* What patterns did you notice across different opportunities?
* What concerns or questions do you still have about seeking funding?

---

Assessment Notes

This is a research and reflection exercise, not a test of your ability to find the "right" opportunities. You're assessed on:

* Thoroughness of research: Did you dig into the details and answer all the questions?
* Critical thinking: Did you read the fine print and think strategically about what these opportunities actually offer and cost?
* Self-awareness: Did you honestly assess where you are and what you'd need to be competitive?
* Clarity of writing: Is your research organized and easy to follow?

This is not assessed on:

* Finding prestigious or highly competitive grants
* Already being "ready" to apply
* Having an impressive practice history

---

Tips for This Research

Be Realistic About Timelines: Many students discover that "emerging artist" grants actually expect 3-5 years of post-graduation exhibition history. That's not a failure on your part—it's useful information for planning.

Watch for Hidden Costs: Some residencies are "free" but don't cover travel or materials. Is the opportunity worth €500 in flights and €200 in clay? Maybe, maybe not.

Read Past Recipients: Most organizations list previous winners. Look them up. What were their practices like? Does your work fit that pattern, or would you be an outlier?

Beware of Vanity Opportunities: If you're paying more than €100 to apply, or if the residency charges you significant fees for the "privilege" of working there, it's worth questioning whether this is really support or just a business exploiting artists.

Geographic Realities: That amazing residency in rural Japan sounds incredible, but if you have caring responsibilities, chronic illness, or can't afford the flight... it's not really an opportunity for you right now. That's okay. There are other paths.

Start Local: Irish artists often overlook local council grants because they seem "small" (€500-€2000), but they're often less competitive and the application is simpler. Local funding can be a stepping stone to national grants.

---

Due Date: [To be announced]

Questions? This research can be overwhelming. If you're stuck, bring your questions to class or office hours. Part of the learning here is realizing that grant-seeking is a skill that develops over time—you're not expected to have it all figured out in one assignment.

---

Additional Resources

Reading the Arts Council: The Arts Council site is dense. Start with "Awards" or "Funding" and filter by artform. Don't skip the eligibility criteria—it's there for a reason.

VAI (Visual Artists Ireland): VAI regularly posts grant opportunities and also offers advice on applications. If you're not signed up for their newsletter, do it.

Ask Working Artists: The best information often comes from artists who've actually been through the process. If you know someone who's held a grant or residency, ask them about the experience—especially the parts that weren't in the official description.

Timeline Awareness: Many major grants have annual deadlines (often Jan-March). If you find something perfect but the deadline was last month, save it for next year and start preparing now.

Week of Sept. 22

Introductory Task: 

On a new word doc please answer the following questions and go through the process below:

1. What are three surprising or useful facts that you carry around with you? If you can’t think of any how would you go about finding some? What sites or tools would you use?
2. Where did you learn these facts? If you wanted to verify them, how would you?

Task: try to verify the facts that you have specified. What are your sources, how do you know that that source is credible or “good”? Do you find any conflicting sources?

Homework: After you have answered those questions, please write a 150-250 word reflection on what was easy or difficult about this these questions and this task: what was unexpected? How did you verify your source? If you had to challenge or critique how you went about answering those questions, what would you say?

How we use and judge sources:

Video activity: Howtown On Youtube

Let’s watch the introduction to this video and see if we can learn something about both the topic and how the creators navigate a complex set of sources and circumstances:

* Examples of sources: What sources do they cite?
* What makes a source reputable? How do they go about doing their research?
* What might make us question the reputability or safety or correctness of a source?
* Why is this topic complex and nuanced?
* How does culture, money, and politics enter into this topic?

Week of Sept. 15

Welcome to Research and Study Skills! 

My name is Josh—together we will embark on an adventure in how we know what we know!

If you have had a research and study skills class in the past, you might find that my interpretation is a bit different than your prior experiences.

What we will (broadly) cover:

* Understand how we know what we know: what research means and how we do it!
* Understand sources and how to use them
* Understand how laws and regulations relate to research and information that is “out there”
* Understand how to fool people with statistics (and maybe why lots of us don’t like the S word)
* Understand different types of arguments and how they relate to sources

How you will be assessed this year:

40% Skills Demonstrations: in class

60% Portfolio/Collection of Work: in and outside of class with 1:1 feedback

Next, let’s do something a bit quiet and relaxed on this Tuesday: 

Please fill out the following form. Note, the more you type, the better I can understand your situation and tailor assignments and feedback to your specific background, circumstances and goals.

Getting to Know You as a Human Being Form.

The Humble Banana

Dear students,

In this class, we will be discussing framing, more importantly we will be discussing a highly contentious topic with broad and deep societal and historical significance: Bananas. This topic has too often been viewed as banal, mundane, quotidian, and other less fancy words for “everyday.” Together, we will approach this topic from four different frames, in an attempt to better understand not just the role of the humble banana in our society, but also how the way we frame facts changes their power, their relevance, and their scope. We will discuss argument, form, and tone, as well as investigating both what sources are easily accessible and what frames those resources contain within them. 

For today’s class, we will be going through this assessment and answering any questions or concerns you might have. For now, there is no due date or assessment criteria for you to meet, we will discuss those next week (when my voice is better). But for now, lets just go through together and have a look.

Your tasks for today:

1. take out a laptop and sign in
2. have a look at the four frames, pick a frame and let me know what you are interested in doing so we have an equal number for each one
3. Start working on research and writing!

Week 9: Pair Querying Activity

Week 8:  Prompts and Prompt Guides

Please try to find the official prompt guides for the following tools, official means it is provided as guidance by the company that created the model... note that this means the models themselves are not good sources of how best to prompt them:

1. Claude (Anthropic)
2. Gemini (Google)
3. ChatGPT (OpenAI)
4. Deepseek (Deepseek)
5. Perplexity (Perplexity)

Please have a look at those guides (or if there are none, please just state that) and make a document that compares and contrasts them.

Some Questions to Consider:

1. How are the guides structured? What headings and categories do they have in common?
2. What prompts are recommended (or what prompts are “not good examples”), are there any commonalities or similarities between the guides when it comes to both what they recommend and what they discourage?
3. What do the guides insist upon when it comes to prompt structure, tone, and length? How do examples factor in? 
4. Where are these guides found? Are they in a place that is easy for Users to find or are they generally meant for developers? (Note, if you are in an API guide, that is likely for developers, not typical end users.) What does your answer tell you about whether they want most users to read those guides? 
5. Based on your findings, how do these expect users to learn how to use their products? What was the most common result in your initial searches? 

What we found in our searches:



Week 7: Break

Week 6: Prompt guides

* Compose 2 distinct multiline prompts for Gemini (or another LLM of your choice) toward creating either a personal statement for your LinkedIn or another professional, public facing text (Cover Letter, etc.). Be sure to include the 3 features we discussed last time in your multiline prompts:
  * Remember, LLM’s are not search engines, getting good responses often means adding some additional sentences of explanation and preference to your instruction or query. (We want to avoid using one line prompts until you get a hang of how these things work, and when they don’t work, if you are not sure if these factors help, do an experiment in two different Gemini windows, one with the following and one without!).
  * Context: What is your why and for whom and other w’s? (is this for a company? where will this be shown? who do you want to reach?)
  * Format: how should your response be structured? Are you looking for a bullet point list that you flush out? Are you looking for a list of questions that you might answer in your profile? Are you looking for a draft of a cover-letter from a job description or series of points that you are already looking at?
  * Tone: how do you want your response and to sound? Do you want a more upbeat, humorous message? Perhaps something more professional or even academic? What level of formality or diction would you like to use? How do you want your reader to feel after reading the response (or your edits to your response)
* Have fun!

An Example of what we did in class below: 

What are we trying to write? A coverletter
What help are we trying to get from the chatbot? We would like a draft of a coverletter
What information do we need to give the chatbot to do its task? 
 Tone: We would like the tone to be professional but with words that are not too full of jargon, or corporate sounding. In the end, we want this coverletter to be friendly and approachable. 
 Format: We would like this draft to be at least 3 paragraphs, with a general introduction connecting our experience to the role, a main body describing some key aspects of our experience in more detail (and how those relate to the job description), and a conclusion that emphasizes our appreciation and excitement for the role.
 Context: What information would someone (or something, including an ai Chatbot) need to be able to complete this task?
I would need to give it a list of experiences (with job titles and descriptions) that I have had, as well as a few achievements or projects that I am proud of.
Job Description: either from the employer or summarized by you (perhaps you can even include a document with that information on it!) You could give the text of the advertisement (Links usually wont work on these things for reasons we will talk about, so lets think of it as copy-paste for now). 
Why you would be a good fit for the job...

Address and specific contact details of employer (salutation, other technical parts of letter)

Week 5: Finding Prompting Guides

Today we will continue from where we left off last week in discussing prompting and prompting guides: to start, let us make sure that we have accounts for the following sources, as well as any other apps you have chosen to explore this year.

Task

See if you can find a prompt guide for Claude.ai, Gemini, and ChatGPT

(From last week)

Prompting First Steps

In general, we will use the following structure and ideas for organizing our prompts.

* LLM’s are not search engines, getting good responses often means adding some additional sentences of explanation and preference to your instruction or query. (We want to avoid using one line prompts until you get a hang of how these things work, and when they don’t work, if you are not sure if these factors help, do an experiment in two different Gemini windows, one with the following and one without!).
* Context: What is your why and for whom and other w’s? (is this for a company? where will this be shown? who do you want to reach?)
* Format: how should your response be structured? Are you looking for a bullet point list that you flush out? Are you looking for a list of questions that you might answer in your profile? Are you looking for a draft of a cover-letter from a job description or series of points that you are already looking at?
* Tone: how do you want your response and to sound? Do you want a more upbeat, humorous message? Perhaps something more professional or even academic? What level of formality or diction would you like to use? How do you want your reader to feel after reading the response (or your edits to your response)

Week 4: Signing Up for Tools, Thinking about Prompts:

Creating Accounts:

Today let us create an account using your personal or college email for the following sites:

* LinkedIn (I would use your personal account and add your college email to your account)
* Gemini (you just need a google account)
* Claude (you can sign in with a google account)

Prompting First Steps

In general, we will use the following structure and ideas for organizing our prompts.

* LLM’s are not search engines, getting good responses often means adding some additional sentences of explanation and preference to your instruction or query. (We want to avoid using one line prompts until you get a hang of how these things work, and when they don’t work, if you are not sure if these factors help, do an experiment in two different Gemini windows, one with the following and one without!).

What level of formality or diction would you like to use? How do you want your reader to feel after reading the response (or your edits to your response)



Week 3: Elaboration on AI and ML Tools

Before delving into the intricacies of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) operate, it's essential to explore various tools that we interact with daily. Many applications we use unknowingly leverage AI and ML technologies. When examining these tools, we can adopt different perspectives: understanding the appropriate context for their usage, identifying potential challenges and risks, and ensuring ethical and safe engagement with these tools.

In the exploration of these applications, several questions and considerations may arise:

* What functionalities does the tool offer, and how does it achieve them?
* What type of data is collected by the tool?
* How is this data utilized to enhance user experience and outcomes?

The following tools or applications utilize AI/ML in diverse ways to assist users in accomplishing a range of tasks. While creating accounts on these platforms is optional for this course, it can be beneficial for advancing your professional objectives.

Today’s Plan:

* Introduction: trying things out
* Discussion of AI/ML Tools and how we will investigate
* Investigation of AI/ML Tools
* Critical Reflection: key questions and goals

Tools we will explore:

* Google Docs
* Google Sheets
* Grammarly
* LinkedIn
* Coda
* Notion
* Canva
* Figma

Key Questions:

1. What does the AI portion of this tool claim to do?
  1. How fast or easy is it to use?
  2. How fast or easy is it to correct when a mistake is made?
  3. How fast or easy is it to opt-out (not use) this tool?
2. What kind of information or data does the AI portion of this tool give me?
  1. What kind of resources does this tool have access to?
  2. How does what I write factor into what is produced?
  3. What kind of options does this tool give me when I use it?
3. What kind of information is collected?
  1. Where does that data go?
  2. How is my data used?
  3. How can I opt out (or in) to this data collection?

Conclusions and Next Steps:

* Over the course of the next few weeks we will look at a variety of applications of AI/ML through tools such as these.
* Is there a particular tool you are interested in exploring and learning about? (There are many more than the ones we have discussed here, from Photoshop to WhatsApp!)
* Is there a particular feature that you are particularly intrigued or enthused by?
* Is there a particular tool you would like to learn better?

Have a look at this video over the next week! Feel free to pause and ponder, rewatch parts that don’t make sense or note your questions for class! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPZh9BOjkQs

Week 2

Establishing Baselines:

Original

Before we jump into how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) work I would like for us to look at a few different tools together. Sometimes the applications we use everyday have aspects that are based on ML and AI and we don’t even know it! When we look at a given application there are at least three lenses we might employ: understanding the right context in which to use that tool, what difficulties and pitfalls might arise, and how we might engage these tools safely and conscientiously. As we go through these applications there are a few questions and ideas we might consider: what does the tool claim to do and how? What data is collected? How is that data used? (For a more full list see below, but feel free to add your own!) Each of the tools (or applications) below use AI/ML in a variety of ways in order to help you accomplish various tasks. You may already have accounts for some of these sites, and while it is not required to make an account for this course, you might find it useful to do so for your professional goals. 

Tool 1: Summarize

The text highlights the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in everyday applications, prompting users to consider the tools' functionalities, data collection methods, and safe engagement. It suggests exploring various tools that leverage AI/ML to accomplish tasks efficiently, emphasizing the optional but potentially beneficial aspect of creating accounts on these platforms for professional purposes.

Tool 2: Shorten

The text discusses how AI and ML are used in everyday apps, urging users to explore tools that utilize these technologies for efficient task completion. It suggests considering functionalities, data collection, and safe usage, with optional account creation on these platforms for professional benefits.

Tool 3: Bullet Points

* Explore different tools together before diving into AI and ML
* Everyday apps may have hidden AI and ML features
* Three lenses to consider when looking at an application: right context, potential difficulties, safe engagement
* Questions to ponder: what the tool claims to do, data collection methods, data usage
* Tools use AI/ML in various ways to assist in task completion
* Optional account creation on platforms for professional goals

Tool 4: Convert to Table

Key Points
* Explore different tools together before diving into AI and ML
* Everyday apps may have hidden AI and ML features
* Three lenses to consider when looking at an application: right context, potential difficulties, safe engagement
* Questions to ponder: what the tool claims to do, data collection methods, data usage
* Tools use AI/ML in various ways to assist in task completion
* Optional account creation on platforms for professional goals


Tool 5: Simpler Language (with some emotional difficulties)

Before we talk about how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) work, let's check out some tools together. Many apps we use every day actually use AI and ML without us knowing. When we look at an app, we can think about three things: when to use it, what problems can come up, and how to use it safely. As we explore these apps, we can ask: what does the app do and how? What information does it gather, and how is it used? The tools below use AI/ML in different ways to help you with tasks. You might already have accounts on some of these sites, and while making an account for this course is optional, it could be helpful for your job.

Tool 6: Elaborate (Whoa boy):

Week 1

My Email: joshuaaaron@dcfe.ie 

Introduction

Over the course of this year, we will explore a series of concepts, tools and best practices regarding three different forms of what generally is called “Artificial Intelligence” but we will refer to as three distinct machine learning applications. This will mean dispelling some myths, uncovering and addressing some biases, and developing both facility and literacy surrounding how ML systems work, how they are sold to businesses, and how they are depicted in media. Hopefully this will enable us to better sort fact from fiction, use these tools effectively, ethically, and safely, and avoid both typical pitfalls and the snake-oil salesmen of today.

This is where our class summaries, reflection questions and other assignments will be posted, and you are welcome to email me with any questions or if you would like feedback on your assignments beyond what we discuss in class. After our initial explorations and building a solid digital foundation, some of the material of this course can be found on LinkedIn Learning (link and classroom forthcoming).  More information and a more concrete structure can be found in the following dropdowns—just click the little triangles on the left to expand! Looking forward to learning with you!

1 Introduction

Introductions: Who am I and Who are You?

On a sheet of paper please write the following in bullet point form:

* Your Full Name
* How you would like to be addressed
* A bit about your background, professional or personal
* What brought you to this class
* What you hope to learn in this class
* What is an unexpected application or use of AI or Machine learning that you have seen in recent years? Note: not necessarily the one that grabbed the most headlines, the one that surprised you, unsettled you or perhaps delighted you.

Next, see if you can write out your bullet points as sentences to make a nice paragraph or two.

Whimsy and Wile:

Please take your answers and make them into a poem. You can use any rhyme or rhythmic scheme, but I recommend a limerick, sonnet, or simple AABB/ABAB scheme.

As you write: why am I asking you to write this poem? How does the task feel?

If you are not comfortable converting your text to a poem, please translate it into another language.

My Example Sentences.

My name is Joshua Aaron.

I would like to be addressed as Josh or Joshua, not sir or mister or any other title.

I have recently, Last August, moved to Dublin from Toronto, where I lived for two years. Before Toronto I lived in Berlin for 8 years, and before that I lived in several cities throughout North America. I have taught, whether formally or informally, in three different cities, I have an academic background in computer science and mathematics, specifically artificial intelligence and machine learning and their relationship to education. I have run a cafe-community center in Berlin as well as managed teams in Education technology startups and social service oriented nonprofits. I hope my diverse background equips me with a breadth of examples and applications for this course.

I was brought to this class by Michael Foley, the principle of this college, as an attempt to see whether LinkedIn Learning could meet the academic needs of a course on AI, specifically in a non-technical capacity. 

As part of my second year in Ireland, I am excited to learn from you and better understand what you are looking for in a course about AI, as there are so many out there in the ether these days. 

I am surprised at how quickly the educational applications of AI have been rolled out by the likes of Khan Academy, a site we will discuss later in this course.

Example Translation



Some Questions for us to Consider

1. How do we determine a tool is fit to purpose?
2. What data questions might we ask of Machine Learning Applications?
3. What concerns might we have of new AI/ML tools?
4. What resources might we use to better educate ourselves on this and related topics?
5. How do we know if a source is credible?
6. What kind of media literacy did I need to navigate the digital world without AI/ML? What types of literacy are now more, or less, important?
7. How can an AI/ML application save me time or effort? Where should we be skeptical of time-saving promises?
8. How can we gain the computer literacy needed to be able to use these tools?

Questions for me?

For next week: Getting to know you as a human being form

Personal & Professional Development

After Reading Week We will discuss...

* Job Applications for Technical Roles (and some tools to help with those)
* Interviews and Hiring Loops (prep, managing less than wonderful interviewers, making good impressions)
* How to use time management and application tracking tools
* Incentives and Structures within Organizations

Week of Oct. 13 and 20

How LLM-Based AI Tools Work - 

* We will have a look at this video together.
* Reflections: Is this how you expected LLM’s to work? What is missing from the video that you would like to understand better? What did you think would play a role that didn’t what played a role that you didn’t expect? 
* These videos are part of a series, if you are interested, play on! There are also a variety of resources on this topic to be found on the following channels which I recommend:
  * Welch Labs
  * Primer
  * Machine Learning Mastery
* We will discuss a “black box” experiment (where we judge what we mean when we say something is trustworthy, or knowledgeable or confident or legitimate... and many more adjectives besides!)

Week of Oct. 6

Using LLM-Based AI Tools 

* Open a Word, Onenote, or Loop file and Give it the title “YOUR NAME AI Exploration”
* See if you can find official prompt guides from the makers of the following models, each should be opened in a different tab.
  * Gemini
  * ChatGPT
  * Claude
  * Copilot
  * Do you have others that you use? Feel free to open tabs for them too if you can find a prompting guide
* Have a read through one of the guides (I recommend Claude’s) and note anything that you notice that surprises or that you didn't expect to be included. Create a summarized or tabulated (with bullet points) version of the guide.
* See if you can write down 3-5 questions about this guide—what information would you like included? What runs contrary to how you thought these machines work?

Week of Sept 29

Reflections on Last Week:

* CV Investigations: what did you learn? What was unexpected? What resources did you settle on?
* How would you assess your CV now?

Creating a Developer Profile 

There are three tools we will look at:

* Github: Lets make an account! (Be sure to include that you are a student)
* Colab: (this involves a google account, but is useful for our class until we fill out more of our GitHub profile)
* Glitch—it looks like this isn't active anymore, but I am looking for alternatives... GitHub pages or code spaces might be your best bet for now

We will be looking at the following jupyter notebook today:

Week1_DeveloperProfile.ipynb

You can also find it on colab here Google Colab Notebook

Planning for the next few weeks:

* What do you want to get out of this course?
* Some ideas from me...

Week of Sept 22

Tasks from Last Week:

* Please bring a CV or description of work experience
* In addition, see if you can find an entry level job in a field you are interested in and see if you can write a cover letter as though you were applying to that job.
* NOTE: while you are welcome to use LLM based AI models, please be prepared to show the prompts you used as well as the models output (this can be done with screenshots or sharing a link to the conversation, something all modern bots allow)

Plan for Today:

* Discuss what you have brought in terms of CVs and Jobs and Cover Letters
* Have a look at what the world says CVs should be:

In a document let’s do the following, please be prepared to submit this to me by Friday at 1pm.

* Starting Reflection: to start, write out what you expect to find in the resources... how will they look, will they be helpful? Where will you find good resources? Will they apply to your situation? How will you search for them?
* Let’s search through and find 3+ resources each that describe what makes a good CV for a recent student, what key attributes do they describe?
* Some Questions to Answer as you find your 3+ sources:
  * Are the sources consistent?
  * Do the CVs look the same?
  * What do the authors assume about who (or what ) will be reading the CV?
  * Is the CV easy to read, or overly flashy?
  * How does the CV handle when there is not much content? (as one would have when one is just starting in a field)
  * How does the advice apply to someone who is changing careers?
  * Other questions you find useful?
* Reflection: Write some thoughts about how your expectations were met or not met, now that you have done the exercise, do you feel differently about searching for resources online? What would you do differently next time?

Week of Sept 15

Welcome to PPD 

My name is Josh—together we will embark on an adventure in learning a bit more about ourselves, understanding our goals and how to achieve them.

If you have had a Personal and Professional development class in the past, you might find that my interpretation is a bit different than your prior experiences.

What we will (broadly) cover:

* Processes for understanding your goals are and how to understand how you can best achieve them
* How systems and structures work and change (and how you relate to that change)
* How to translate your goals into a series of steps and projects
* How to gauge whether you have learned something sufficiently to move forward
* Investigate and use a variety of tools to help you in this and other classes

How you will be assessed this year:

50% Skills Demonstrations: in class

50% Portfolio/Collection of Work: in and outside of class with 1:1 feedback

Next, let’s do something a bit quiet and relaxed on this Tuesday: 

Please fill out the following form. Note, the more you type, the better I can understand your situation and tailor assignments and feedback to your specific background, circumstances and goals.

Getting to Know You as a Human Being Form.

Tasks for Next Tuesday:

* Please bring a CV or description of work experience for next Tuesday’s class
* In addition, see if you can find an entry level job in a field you are interested in and see if you can write a cover letter as though you were applying to that job.
* NOTE: while you are welcome to use LLM based AI models, please be prepared to show the prompts you used as well as the models output (this can be done with screenshots or sharing a link to the conversation, something all modern bots allow)

Housekeeping:

* Attendance is highly encouraged — I cannot force you, but getting a distinction on this course should be highly doable
* You will indeed have work to do and things to watch or read outside of class
* Moodle is coming
* This site is where a lot of stuff will live

Mathematics

November 4

Summary of what we have covered so far:

* Matrices as “Box-o-numbers”
* Vectors as “List-o-numbers”
* dot product
* matrix multiplication
* exponents and matrix exponentiation (and some patterns that might arise)
* solving linear equations with matrices (three operations:
  * Swap Rows
  * Add one row to another row (leaving the first row alone)
  * multiply a row by a scalar (this gives us subtraction of one row from another (because of multiplication by a negative number), and division by a scalar (because of multiplication by a fraction))
  * Any combination of the three until we get to the identity matrix on the left and a series of constants on the right.

Practice Problem for Today:

Can you find a 2x2 matrix that multiplies with itself to get -I (the Identity matrix (2x2) times negative 1)? What does that matrix look like? (We will come back to this later). Let's call this the square root of -I or $\sqrt(-I)$ = J. If you finish that can you find something that squares to make J? Did you have to use a different method?

After Midterm Break

After the midterm break we will transition from discussing matrices to discussing probability and functions. Just as a reminder from what we discussed in class, here is our approximate plan for the rest of the college year:

* November-December: Probability, Statistics, and Functions
* January: Functions, Calculus (Basic Derivatives and Integrals), and plotting
* February: Odds and Ends (Trigonometry and Tying things together)
* March: Neural Networks Project with Digit and Letter Recognition, and Exam Review
* April: Exam Review and Exam
* May: Exam Results

October 24:

Today we worked on the first 3 sections of the Lists and Matrices Notebook which you can work on on Colab (just make sure you save a copy in your own drive, or your inputs will not be saved) or download and work on locally. We then discussed how to think about list comprehensions as for loops and how those relate to our matrix operations. Finally we went through the plan for Maths and assignments (in class skills demos) when you return.

October 22:

Today we will got through some of the code for matrix multiplication as well as how things look visually (using the code in the linear algebra notebook that we have been using). We will also discuss a couple examples of “interesting” 2x2 and 3x3 matrices like rotation matrices and scaling matrices to build up our “programming language of matrices” that we discussed last week.

October 21:

Today we explored a couple more examples of 2x2 matrix multiplication as well as taking a matrix to a given power (using exponents). We discussed the pattern that happens when we have the matrix [[1,1],[0,1]] and take it to the nth power.

In addition we went through the indexing that we use with matrices, how this “box of numbers” forces us to have a really clear idea of two indices combined (so we had

the bottom right of a matrix). We also went through the “cross” of indices above, below, left and right, as well as how these relate to dimension.  

October 17:

Today we continue on with Matrix Multiplication, thinking through a few key examples and shapes of matrices (diagonal, identity, zero, row multiplier, row adder) to see how they work in the 2x2 and 3x3 case (and begin to introduce how that looks visually. For fancier graphics than I can do by hand, check out  3Blue1Brown's Series on Linear Algebra (both written and video)—we will be stopping at Cramers Rule.

October 14-15:

Today we are going to make the transition from the dot product to matrix multiplication (both on the board and in code). To do that we will have a look at the following resources:

Start with Linear Algebra Fundamentals

If you are looking for python and jupyter tutorials, have a look at these notebooks (they are drafts, so please let me know if you find any errors).

Go to Google Drive

October 8 and 10:

Here is what we discussed today! Have fun creating the functions for both dot product and scalar multiplication! We will go through these on Friday and Tuesday. Note: sometimes the simplest thing you can do is the right thing! No need to over-complicate :) 

Open hyperlink

Tuesday October 7th:

Plan for today

Today we will be continuing to look at vectors and matrices, in particular we will start by going through what we touched on last week (vector/matrix addition, subtraction, our “weird multiplication” of vectors).

We will in🦺i🏰 (bonus points if you can figure out that word) what happens when we look at vectors and their operations graphically (using the ill-named cartesian plane, which we will just call the coordinate plane). But also, we will start of on our adventure of coding up these vectors as lists and create a few basic functions in python together. If we are lucky, we will get to matrix multiplication at the end, but that will likely come tomorrow—remember, all this stuff can be found online so there is no need to fret about taking notes or memorizing anything. 



October 1st-3rd

Today we will be looking over the basics of lists, vectors, and matrices, for that we will use some experimental notebooks that I have been working on that might change over the coming weeks as we better figure out what kind of support might be needed. In general, these are modified from prior sheets I have made that were adapted to “you in 2 months”... so lets see how we do with them now!  

Tuesday September 30

Some stuff we went through on tuesday



Wednesday and Friday September 23 and 26

Hour 1:

* Khan Academy: Individual Plan and Practice
  * Using Khan Academy, see if you can ascertain what level is right for you to start practicing. Some key chapters to consider:
    * Fractions (addition and subtraction, multiplication, division)
    * Logarithms
    * Negative Exponents
    * Cartesian Coordinates (Graphing)
    * Trigonometric Functions (especially sketching them)
    * Solving Systems of Equations
  * I will come around and ask you a few questions:
    * 1. what units would you like time to work on in class for the next couple sessions with help from me? 
    * 2. What units do you think you can best tackle at home (without assistance)
    * 3. What other types of resources might prove helpful? (Videos, other math resources—I have loads, but it depends on what kind of practice you would like to do!)
    * 4. Are you comfortable creating your own practice problems? Instead of just using ones given to you (see your exploration sheet for exponents for what I mean).
    * As always: If several people would like practice on the same thing, I will gladly carve out time and make some material covering it in a way that more relates to where we are going! :)

Shifting how we think about Maths:

Josh waxes rhapsodic (says pretty words) about:

* Objects
* Functions and operations
* Tuples, Lists, Matrices (Numbers in Lines and Boxes)
* Composition and Types of Functions and Representations (Recursion, Probability, Distributions)

Where we are headed:

* A toy neural network to play around with: https://playground.tensorflow.org/
* A full implementation of a neural net in python https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/#
* https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning

Practice (at home or if you feel you are comfortable with the material):

Using Pseudocode in a Jupyter Notebook let’s aim toward describing a method for computing addition (or, in order of difficulty, subtraction, multiplication, division) as you learned in grade school. We assume that each number is broken into a number of digits. 

Warm Up: Equality

Given two strings of the same unknown length, with some number of symbols, how would you determine if the two strings are equal?

Challenge 0: Same Length

Given two strings, how would you determine if the strings are the same length. As a bonus, see if you can use a method that you create that find the length of a string... (otherwise you can just assume we have a way of knowing a strings length.)

Challenge 1: Digit Sum

Given two lists of the same length where each entry in the list is a number, how would you write down a process for getting a new list where each entry is the sum of the two lists at that same entry?

Challenge 2:

Optional Coding Challenge: If you would like to use a Jupyter Notebook (and write code) you are welcome to try this as a series of exercises (this may relate to a future assessment). Note: this uses aspects of python you haven’t learned yet, so the idea is first to describe these in English. (If you want to try code, go head of course, but only after writing in English.)



Friday September 19

Have a look at the following worksheet, I hope to have a printed version for you tomorrow but just in case here is the digital backup!

Exploratory_Worksheets.pdf

Today we will discuss Khan Academy, the plan for the year, as well as this worksheet.

Wednesday Sept 17

Your current level in Maths

Today we are going to go through the Maths Australia Placement Test:

The goal is to see where you fall, where your gaps are and where you struggle. If you dont know the answer to a question, feel free to put I don’t know, if you get through a test, go ahead and go to the next one. If you get through lots of them, great! If you are struggling with the first one, also great! We will get you where you need to be for this course and we will make sure that everyone goes at their own pace, while keeping the class together when discussing important ideas and connections between areas of math and computer science.

NOTE: You do not need a calculator for the first 3 tests (not sure about the 4th-6th)

Start with the Mathematics Australia Pre-Algebra Assessment

The source for that link was here (just in case it doesn’t work for you). Click on the left option if you feel like you really struggled with math, and the right if you think you have some maths knowledge under your belt and want to see how far you can go.

When you are done with the first test, go on to the next one! :) Keep going as long as you can! :) 

If you do not like how that test is structured and would like a more general test, check out this one from Monroe College

College Maths Self Assessment

After you complete your assessment:

When you are done, go ahead and sign up for Khan Academy using this link:

WA_Assignment1_Level5.pdf

Today we will discuss the brief and get working on setting up our repository and planning your website. You are welcome to use any and all resources that we have referenced below. If you would like to use other resources or documentation, please let me know before doing so.

Week of October 27

Term Break!

Week of October 20

Today we will go through the basics of Github and figure out how to correct a piece of code on a large HTML/CSS project.

—My Github (Where practice and tutorials and experiments can be found!)

Week of October 13

* Make sure you have a GitHub account with your college email attached
* Go to this link and see if you can make a change to the files there—perhaps first by downloading them and seeing what the code runs. Can you change the background or text to make the first paragraphs more visible?https://github.com/deweydex/HTML-CSS-SQL-JS
* See if you can create a change and get me to both notice the change and adopt it in my code... what needs to happen for you to do that? What systems or computers are involved?
* What terminology do you come across? What challenges did you face? Were there any resources that you used?

Friday October 10

— What we are doing today: tutorials, 

— Continuing on from Wednesday: What challenges did you face? can you create a totally new web page from scratch? How are the exercises going in the guided version?

— SQL demo updates: I will have a new set of demos for you on Tuesday and Wednesday, nothing new though—for now let’s just make sure what we have talked about makes up a solid foundation

Wednesday October 8

Open Version (more freedom, more responsibility, more background knowledge required)

See if you can make a simple webpage using a tax simulator without using any external resources.

tax_simulation_real-2.html.zip

See if you can edit the file to create a personal website. What colours would you change? What sizes and fonts?

Closed Version (Less freedom, more steps, less background required)

Download the following zip file Break and Make a Website.zip and open the Readme and QuickStart guides—see if you can do the following:

1. Open the HTML file in a browser
2. Complete the exercises in both the Readme and QuickStart guides
3. Fix any problems you notice with the website itself

If you finish or would like to have a project more relevant to future assignments:

See if you can create a GitHub pages “page” using Jekyll 

* https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart
* https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll

Can you create a personal web page? How does the CMS work? 

Web Authoring Foundations

The Odin Project—we will discuss how to do this off line.

* Using Markdown cells in a Jupyter Notebook, 
*  Some questions you might ask:
  * How is the tutorial structured, what media are used? Is it a series of lessons? Projects? Videos? 
  * What is your first impression of the tutorial site itself, before even beginning the tutorial? Is it flashy, minimal, fun/funny, professional... is it free or paid?
  * How long do you think it would take to do this tutorial? Does the site say how long? How deep/broad does this tutorial go?
  * How do you know if this resource is credible or up to date? When was it last updated
  * Is Javascript involved? How much knowledge is expected? what are the prerequisites? 
  * What other questions might you have, can you think of three more that matter to you?
  * Would you personally use this resource?
* Reflections: How did this exercise go, what made it different or similar to previous exercises you have done in technical classes?

The above pages are where (as of September 2024) my various teaching material and musings live. This will be an ever growing and changing set which I will attempt to organize sensibly as I go. To start, I highly recommend going to the section labeled most applicably to your situation.

For Employers:

Thank you for having a look at my work! The Assorted Teaching Materials Page is a collection of my work from previous teaching contexts in addition to links to external sites that I am affiliated with or have worked with before. As some of the material I have produced in the past is considered proprietary to businesses such as Paper.co and Nelson Education, but I have tried to make available as much content as possible for you to get a feel for how I think about the subjects I teach. All of my work is highly flexible in terms of medium, duration, learning outcome, and applicability to learning standards and competancies (I juggle at least 4 different national curricula when I conceptualize lessons). Most importantly, my material affords high levels of differentiation, individualized learning outcomes, adaptive assessments, as well as a variety of classroom set ups and styles. While the goings on inside my head change as I read and experiment and, as is most common, learn from my students, How I Think About Teaching can give you at least a snapshot.

For Students:

If you are in one of my classes and have been referred here by a link from me, welcome! Feel free to peruse the sections that you find interesting and helpful, if you have any questions, you know how to reach me!

Some of the pages here are very much guides for the perplexed, oppinionated writing designed to get you thinking and feeling about your learning, how you engage and how you are best able to teach yourself! You can of course start with the subject that you are interested in, and many of you are worried about tests and homework, but I would recommend starting with How I Recommend Learning to Learn, it is a bit of a different guide to learning based on some things I wrote in my first years of teaching in both LA and Berlin. I hope these and other words prove helpful, but as you will hear from me in class, don’t be afraid to experiment, try things out, write about what you did, what you learned... Your reflections on your learning adventures are just as valuable as what you learned!

For Parents:

If you have a learner in one of my classes and have been referred here by me, welcome! If you have found your way here through other means, you are just as welcome but you might require a couple more sentences of introduction to understand what the heck all these words are! This is a webpage which all of my students have access to in addition to any Content Management System (CMS) or Learning Content Management System (LCM... for some reason the S is often left out of the acronym). Here (and on such platforms) learners will be able to find worksheets and links to resources to help in thier learning. My courses have a mix of more traditional structures, as well as those which might be unfamiliar. Writing (in the form of reflections, project logs, and check-ins) and Reading comprise important parts of my classes, and, while these aspects are not graded for content, experience shows that those students who engage in these non-technical aspects of learning tend to perform significantly better at various standardized assessments, not to mention succeed more readily in the course overall. If you have questions or concerns about my teaching methods and practice, please feel free to write me an email or fill out the contact form on the main page. Your child’s success in learning and assessment is of the utmost importance to me. We are on the same team, and your involvement in your child’s learning journey and dedication to helping them succeed can serve to greatly enhance their experience in my and other classes. Giving a learner enough space to explore and experiment, but not to flounder and flail, enough to make mistakes but not alienate themselves from the subject matter at hand, is a difficult balence to strike, whether as teacher or parent. If you have concerns that your child is not getting the attention they deserve or that they need some kind of particular attention given to their indiviual learning plan, feel free to contact me and we can sort everything out.

For Teachers and Educators:

This part of this page is under construction—for now, feel free to contact me with any questions, comments, complaints, or concerns regarding any of the work or content you find here! If you would like to use any of the resources I have produced in your classroom or as part of a larger learning plan, so long as you are part of a public or non-profit institution, all I ask is that you let me know with an email and attribute my work as you would any other resource. If you are a private or for profit institution, company, or business, please send me an email and I am sure that we can come to mutually beneficial terms. In either case, I am of course happy to produce versions tailored to your teaching circumstance with more restrictive copywrite if that is what you are looking for. All roads lead to just sending a quick email using the form on the main page and I will get back to you as soon as possible!


Assorted Teaching Materials

Teaching Materials: Click on the Titles!

My teaching and content (and management) styles are informed by progressive education movements in both a European and American context, though are also influenced heavily by some truly amazing pedagogs: I owe a great debt to the praxis-oriented methods of Paulo Friere, ideas around learner independence and self determination as described by Maria Montessori and John Dewey, along with more modern educational giants such as the creators of Big Picture School (Dennis Littky and Elliot Washor), the late but great Dr. Ken Robinson, and a few others who I will include in the resources and recommendations section. Below are a few examples of my work from my time teaching, unfortunately, the vast majority of the work I produced for organisations such as Nelson and Paper remains their property and I am not able to share them here. Here are a few exercises, learning material and workshops I have produced along with some context surrounding their creation or delivery. Since some of them are several years old now, they are not exactly a depiction of my current pedagogical preferences, but they offer a way to see how I used to teach, which certainly informs my current practice.

Measuring the World: an Introduction to Modeling and Scientific Notation (8-10th Grade)

This series was delivered to a fantastic 8th-grade bilingual Math class under the mentorship of David Brown. It served as part of teacher-practicum evaluation while at Nelson Mandela School during the Computer Science and Mathematics Education Masters Program at the Freie Unversitaet zu Berlin. These kids had a blast, and while my evaluator initially thought there was no way to have 8th graders learn the material this way, by the end the students showed that often the biggest barriers are those placed in front of learners by teachers, without them the sky is the limit… or perhaps the stars?

Fun With Functions (11th-12th Grade)

This multipart-series served as an Introduction through the lens of Information and Coding Theory administered to an 11th-grade and 12th-grade class as an experiment in norm-setting and reflection and how those might inform my teaching practice. Dr. Sainza Fernandez was an amazing mentor supporting my focus on what are often considered ancillary, less content-focused goals. I had previously not produced material relating to the practice of writing reflections and giving guidance to learners about how to actively play with the types of problems posed (more open-ended, exploratory questions). The results were mixed, it turns out a few months of me talking at them and getting discussions going did not undo the years of conditioning of the German school system toward closed problems and "right/wrong" binaries. There were just too many changes all at once, though some students did really latch on to these differences in approach. While the results were positive and learners produced some truly inspired coding schemes and seemed to digest the concepts well, these days I would treat the material quite differently: fewer words, more hands on experience and student-led and defined problems.Evaluation of the Impact of # 

Comics on Exam Performance: Link to Exam

Interspersed with far-side comics, (here provided without those to avoid a copyright issue), this exam serviced as part of the masters research project while studying at the Freie Universitaet zu Berlin administered at the Nelson Mandela School to two (lucky?) 10th-grade math classes. Research results were inconclusive as they were based upon too small a sample size, but the project was fun, and it was the first time most kids had ever chuckled during a math test. Creating a fun and challenging standardized test was a blast, though of course timing and differences to their normal exam structure surely influenced results. Caveats aside, I think multiple choice gets a bad reputation because most are not particularly fun, funny or challenging, fixing those three things yields significant benefits for the learner (and the teacher)!

Socio-Emotional Learning in STEM Contexts: Link to Workshops

(Pending) These handouts were produced as part of a series of workshops given to STEM and Humanities tutors while working at Paper.co under a great manager and informed by a great head of teaching and learning. I learned a great deal giving these workshops: that often we, as teachers, are informed and shaped by our own educational experiences in ways that are difficult to notice, assess, and (should we find them unhelpful) change. As I now often work in adult learning contexts, I find focusing on this very aspect, what habits and expectations an adult learner brings with them from their schooling, is often more important than access to quality teachers or content.
Norms & Expectations

Introduction — Learning Happens in Your Head

Let me start by saying what this text is not: this is not a list of rules. Ours is a classroom where we each, as individuals, learn various things together. Most of the learning will not happen in this classroom, but rather on your own time, whether at home, your favorite coffee shop, pub, or library. Studying can certainly happen in groups, and group assignments will almost certainly arise over the course of our time together, but the learning can only happen in your head. You can only demonstrate that learning through effort spent in working on assignments, assessments, projects, reflections, and other products. Can some of those sessions be done in groups—absolutely! I just want to emphasize that the actual learning, and the evidence of that learning in what you produce, happens by connecting exactly one brain to the keyboard. With that out of the way, let’s jump right into some administrivia!

Short Version: Mutual Respect + Communication + Self-Honesty

You are welcome to read the words below, or refer to the FAQs section (which may or may not be under construction) but the general way that I conduct my classes is less about rules and more about norms and equitable treatment. Ours is a group made up of (young) adults, meaning that everyone is in my class because they seek to achieve a certain goal. What that goal is likely depends (at least somewhat) on the individual, though it is likely partially dicated by the educational and economic structure in which we find ourselves.

I genuinely want you, and every student in our class, to succeed. That success needs to take into account where each learner starts and how far they have progressed. With this in mind, my assessments tend to either use online resources or are project based. Both require you to demonstrate mastery of certain competencies, but both do not involve terminal grades after one attempt, but rather a variety of opportunities for improvement. As in all things, the more effort you put in, the more you engage with the material and methods in this course, and the more you demonstrate that effort and engagement through participation, submission of assignments, and reflections, the more easily I can see what you have learned, the more easily I can intuit where you might need some extra assistance or resources, and the more time and flexibility I will be willing to give you.

As this is a classroom of adults, it is my assumption that you are able to either articulate or simply act upon your needs: You do not need to ask permission to use the washroom, drink water, eat food, take a call (outside of the classroom), take a five minute break or request one for the group, etc. Since we will often be surrounded by computers, this involves some common sense changes to behavior (open beverages are to be handled with caution, oily food near keyboards doesn’t respect that device’s next user, and so on). Overall, this is a space where we are all here to learn, that means accomodating each other’s learning styles, educational background, propensities and difficulties, successes and struggles. 

Communication is a two way street, I will do my best to be both clear and concise (that last one is far harder for me) in my communications with you, so that you can know what to expect, what changes arise, and what to look out for. For more about communication see below!

Attendence and Punctuality

It is assumed that you attend every class, from start to finish and attendence will be taken. This is especially important for those who recieve welfare or are part of certain governmental program. For the first portion of nearly every class we will engage in intention setting and planning, for the last portion of nearly every class we will engage in reflection, if you are late, or must leave early, please let me know the reason via email or message and submit your planning or reflection as usual within 48 hours. If you know that you will be late or must leave early, please send me a message with a brief explanation as soon as you are aware of the delay. Should lateness or leaving early prove to be a pattern, please expect me to reach out so that we can have a conversation: the goal is to aid in your learning, not to punish or chastize you. If you are struggling generally to meet other expectations of the course, let us figure out some ways that your learning can best be supported. 

Illness and Other Absences

If there are any unforeseen absences, for example you are sick or had to handle a personal emergency just go ahead and let me know via email/message. If a pattern emerges or you will be out for a sigificant amount of time (or have some kind of scheduling conflict), the general advice is the same: just let me know, let’s talk about it and we will work something out. 

Make Up Classes

If I am absent for more than one class we will work on what makup work looks like to potentially cover material that we missed. We will work together to figure out a format and schedule that works for the most people—if we have to split the class in two, we will make that work (the time is on me, after all, not on you all). If there is a need for a subsitute you will be informed as soon as I know the situation!

Communication and Professionalism

In general we will use (Moodle?) as well as email for communication about our work together. Handouts will appear on Moodle but can also be found here (and should be sent to your email once settings have been so configured). The following are some general ideas about communication as well as specific norms that will help us to communicate better, both between teacher and student and amongst yourselves as students.

How we communicate in a given context depends on lots of factors big and small: everything from our age, mother-tongue, dialect, upbringing, culture and prior educational and professional experiences shape how we speak and write to each other. Today, sometimes it can be difficult to understand how to address people in different circumstances. During my courses I try to include a day where we discuss communication, but I can give a brief overview of expectations here. The general idea is to think of all communications we share as taking place within a professional context.

1. When we write to each other (and when we speak to each other), no matter what medium (email, chat, code comment, etc.) we should use full sentences whenever possible and avoid using words that refer to other words or ideas like “that, it, thing” or even “the assignment” or “the question” when the other person might not super clear what particular “thing” is being referenced. 
2. In written communication we will use capitalization (especially of words like I and proper nouns) and be as grammatical as possible (sometimes, when discussing math and computer science terms, grammar can be confusing!). If you need any advice or help with your writing, there are lots of great tools online (Grammarly for example) and there are plenty of folks who can help around, just ask!
3. We want to explain answers to problems and questions, no matter the subject; this means more than showing your work, it also means “teaching to the page” which we will discuss more in class, and in an upcoming handout.

Submissions

To be determined based on platform constraints: short answer, on Moodle.

Notes and Note Taking

In many classes there are those who worry that if they do not take notes they will miss a key piece of information or not know how to study properly. In my class you can expect me to be fully transparent about my policies, assignments, assessments, and projects as well as why and how I made the decisions that shaped them. One of my main goals is that you, as a student, become more aware of both how you learn and how to find and evaluate the information you need. Sometimes this means abandoning old habits, or creating new ones: while note-taking is certainly allowed in my class, you should know that it is not necessary. The information in my courses exist “out there,” none of it is new, none of it is particularly difficult to find. I will of course provide recommendations and resources, as well as handouts and assignments that I have created to supplement and support your learning. But “missing something” is not a possibility in my courses: if you learn the material of the module (which will be posted publically and repeatedly), how you learned it is less important than the fact that you learned it. There are so many ways of getting excited about and engaging with the stuff we are learning together, I will do my best to provide you with multiple resources with differring looks, feels, and media. All this is to say, notes are welcome, but not necessary. While it can be difficult, try to remember that we are in class to learn stuff and have fun doing so!

End of Year Reflections

Hello fellow learners,



what a year it has been. For those of you expecting a standard feedback form, prepare to be surprised. As our school year comes to a close, there are few questions we might reflect on, these are emotional questions, not academic ones, but don’t let that e-word fool you: they are as much about understanding your subject as they are about understanding your learning. 

Format: this is a webpage, so this isn’t really a form, per-se, the idea is to open up a document (whether word or .txt or a jupyter notebook if you, like me, have become addicted to markdown), and allow your answer to one question flow into the next. This means, unlike normal forms, the idea is that you read all the questions beforehand, and then choose those that most resonate with you. If you would like you can share the answer with me, if not, you are welcome to keep your answer to yourself. Obviously, I cannot force you to reflect, and there are so many pressing things that call for your attention these days, but I hope, given the level of trust that we have built over the past year as part of this class, that you will indulge me this more humanistic exercise. So, without further ado, take a breath, stretch, give yourself a moment to settle, and lets get reflecting.

1. Can you think of a particular topic or idea that you really struggled with before this year that now you feel you understand deeply? What brought about that transition?
2. What specific aspects of our class did you find helpful and enjoyable, what were the parts where you you changed your feelings or opinions? (For example, first you liked something but ended up find it less useful, or the reverse!)
3. What about the culture of the class worked for you or didn’t work for you? Is there some aspect that initially you were frustrated by but eventually you liked (or at least appreciated)? What parts of the cadence of the class worked, and what didn’t? How come?
4. How did you find the assignments and class time? Were you able to connect with me and with colleagues or did you prefer to work on your own? How did your impressions of the material covered in those assignments/classes change overtime?
5. How have your personal goals changed over the course of the year? Did something in our class change what you think and feel about your future? 
6. What is a habit or pattern of behavior that you noticed this year that you would like to hold on to for next year (whatever that year might hold)? Is there a habit that you would like to abandon next year, or perhaps transform into something else? 
7. How would you say your impression of our class’s subject has changed over the course of the year? What was surprising? What is something that if you told your past self, they wouldn’t believe it (or wouldn’t understand it!)?
8. When you think about your level of confidence in our subject, both overall and in class, what are the things that you would say increase that feeling of confidence? What gets in the way? Has this changed over the course of the year? If so, in what way? If not, is there some direction you would like to take to change your confidence level?
9. When studying a subject it can be easy to lose the big picture the “why am I doing this again?” feeling can be really strong: for your future self, what is something that you gained from this class that has changed the way you think about your field overall? Was there a time when you lost your perspective this year? What happened and what did you do to try to get yourself back on track? (Or, if you are in the middle of figuring that out, maybe think through some things you might do to refocus yourself and better understand your goals.)
10. Technical subjects can often feel separate from more creative subjects, but let’s try to abandon that bias! Can you think of a time this year that you felt really creative in our class? Can you think of a time where you were challenged and had to really think differently from the way you thought before in order to move forward? Were there moments where you started doing something a different way and that opened up your understanding?
11. How would you say your emotional state has changed over the course of the year (maybe think of a graph, are there lots of little ups and downs, some big swings up/down, is the curve smooth, or choppy...) ? What things outside of your education had a positive or negative effect on your studies?
Independent Learning Plan

During most classes with me, each of us will generally be learning at our own pace, punctuated by group practice or discussion. In order for that to work, and for all of us to better learn how to set goals and take responsibility of our own learning, occasionally we will each create an Independent Learning Plan. This can be done using a template (check your course page for a link if I have mentioned one!) or just answering the following questions on a physical or digital piece of paper.

Key questions:

1. What will you accomplish over what period of time? It can help to think of a STAR Goal framework: 

* SPECIFIC – Define what you want to achieve. This usually is in the form of a certain number of exercises on a specific topic (For example, 20 problems about factoring polynomials, or 8 exercises involving python for-loops.)
* TIMELY – When do you want to achieve the goal? (A specific date/class-period, try to give yourself enough time to get things done, but not too much time that it feels abstract and not urgent.)
* ACTION ORIENTED – How will you achieve the goal? (What specific steps will you take!)
* REALISTIC – Is the goal attainable? What might stand in your way?

If you need to change the date that you estimated, or run into other issues, that is totally fine, these are guidelines and goals, not written in stone.

If you would like problems or questions from other resources or from me (I always am up for giving nice little problems) just let me know! :) 

2. How you will accomplish your goal? This is usually about discussing what resources you will use as well as what amount of time you will spend. Since part of your goal might involve producing something (like a computer program that generates random numbers) you can outline the steps you would take to get that done.  What specific actions will you take? Where will you find your exercises? What file structure will you use for your project? Is there a framework or step-by-step process you will use? Are there things you will check your program for? Will you make sure you wrote out steps as evidence?

3. What challenges or hurdles might stand in your way? What might make accomplishing your goal difficult? Most importantly: what will you do to overcome those challenges? 

Sometimes the biggest challenges we face are physical, feeling tired, or unfocused. Sometimes it is not clear what the next steps should be or we might be struggling with our confidence level. This section is not about being overly optimistic or pessimistic, but for outlining the real and present issues we might face when we go about a given task.

You are welcome (encouraged even!) to send me your plans (or show me in person) and discuss them with me in class. If you are looking for resources or confused about how to take the next step, or even just unsure about what a useful and realistic goal is, I am here, and feel free to ask a friend about their plan or include them in it as a source of feedback or to check your knowledge.

As always, questions and comments and suggestions are welcome! If some part of the above isn't clear or doesn't make sense, maybe I can fix it to make it better or easier! Good luck!


Learning Student Backgrounds

In the first weeks of my classes I spend a good deal of time learning the level, academic background, and emotional connections of my students in reference to the subjects I am teaching. Sometimes this takes the form of in-class informal poll, other times I use questions (and forms) like those below to be able to get a lot of quantitative and qualitative data quickly and easily.

What are some of your interests? I can start to get the ball rolling! I love to read, I am a fan of fancy coffee and tea and the cafes that serve them, I’m an avid woodworker, I love dark chocolate and mint and fresh baked crusty bread and vegetarian cooking, I recently dove into the world of house-plants, but had to give them away when we moved so I am back to just a couple cuttings. I mostly listen to Jazz and Classical Music with a few more popular things thrown in. I love hiking, I’m a long time meditator, I used to dance and will hopefully get back into that this year (swing, salsa, bachata, cha-cha, etc.), I generally love to learn and educational youtube is my guilty pleasure, I relish all things related to books: audio books, physical books, libraries, bookstores and more. In terms of subjects I am a pretty broad reader, everything from poetry and philosophy to astrophysics and immunology. I tend to like when examples are practical, but not “everyday,” when they make me learn something beyond just what we are covering. 




Have you lived anywhere other than Dublin? If not, where in Dublin? If so, where? I’ve lived in quote a few cities throughout my life, but I always marvel at those who have deep roots in a place.




Do you speak any other languages besides English? (Personally I speak German as well as a bit of a few other languages)

How to Learn Programming

Introduction

This guide will hopefully be a little bit different from most guides out there on how to learn programming in the mid 2020s. I will indeed give some concrete advice about what one can use and steps to get started, but the Resources and Recommendations Page contains more context specific suggestions for specific subjects and use cases.

What Do You Mean By Programming?

In my experience there are at least five types of programming: they are certainly all related, but the task of “learning programming” usually involves starting to learn one of these broader types:

1. Programming Contests or Puzzles
2. Scientific or Financial Programming
3. Programming Applications (Back-end, mid-layer, native)
4. Graphics, Front-End and Web Programming
5. Low-Level Programming

Note that some areas require practices and ideas and languages from more than one of these broad types. In particular, learning how to create computer games likely involves learning several ways of thinking about programming, especially graphics heavy games or games involving complex mechanics. 

There are many philosophies and opinions around what one ought to learn first, I don’t really ascribe to a prescriptive sense of “should” here: learn whatever gets you excited and interested so that you can continue! But if you are learning with me in a class or just on your own, here are a few steps that you might want to think about while tackling a specific project, especially in the beginning when your goals might outstrip your (initial) capabilities.

Aside: if you are learning how to program in order to accomplish something specific, like create a game or an app, diving into one of the other areas of programming might be a nice smooth introduction. In my courses we focus on learning how to learn programming and the connected subjects like math and computer science and how that might reflect 

A Coding Process for Bigger Challenges

When confronted with a programming challenge, especially one which appears to be pretty big and where you aren't sure where to begin, there are a few basic rules of thumb which can do wonders for your confidence and get you on a path toward both understanding the scope of the problems you need to solve and what order you might best approach those problems.

1. Write the introduction or even the entire assignment brief in your own words: This will help you to highlight the parts you find important and also give you a chance to figure out what you don't understand. If the brief is very vague or big like "build a website for yourself" or "create a map for a game and the functions behind it," start by writing out (in words) the smallest simplest thing you can think of that might get the job done. 
2. As you think through a problem (or are having a look through an assignment brief or question), think through and note down what variables you might need and what type of variables they might be. If you are not sure of what datatype to use, think through what you need the variables to do, what they need to store, how they will be manipulated, and then have a look at some documentation about various data structures that might solve that problem. To start, pick the simplest, even if it doesn't meet all of your needs or seems not to be perfect, better to start with something than nothing!
3. Write out a list of the behaviours you would like your program to accomplish: see if you can break down each bigger behaviour like "tell the user where they are located" into as many substeps as you can, for example: provide a prompt to the user and a chance for them to somehow ask where they are, receive user input, process that input amongst a few options (including "where am I?") and the provide an answer to the user based on a variable that we have stored earlier (if you haven't stored a variable, might want to put that at the top of your list of steps).
4. Think through the conditions (if/else statements) you need to check, what variables do you need to check and for what property or amount? If you are able to see how those behaviours might map to functions, think through what you need each function to take as input (what types are those variables, if any?) and what type you need them to output. Feel free to have these if then statements and function definitions kind of hanging loose in your editor with "TODO" comments showing what needs to happen before and after.


NOTE: all of the above can be done in any text document, or on paper, if you would like to try just jumping into code that's fine, some folks are planners, and others write lots of comments in their code that go over these things. 

When you get to the actual coding, don’t be afraid to use the simplest text editor you can! Especially in the beginning, a fully fledged IDE can seem a bit overwhelming, and with so many options and tools available, it can get easy to spend an hour or more configuring and never actually get to solving the problem you intended to. For my courses I recommend using online “lite” IDEs first, whether Jupyter Notebooks, online C# interpeters, Replit, and more. With that in mind, lets dive into what one might do when one starts with a blank screen!

1. Start defining variables and functions with names that make sense to you. A good variable name is one that is descriptive and often might be longer than we would like, the worst thing is an abbreviated name that you can't recognize later! 
2. Comments, even multi-line comments are your friends! Describe your thoughts and intentions as you code, this will help you solve problems before they happen and figure out changes you might need to make later on.
3. Print statements are also your friends! If you need to check the state of a variable before an if statement or during a loop, go ahead and print it out with a little string that says where that print-out happened! Digital ink is free-don't be afraid to have lots of little statements saying what is happening throughout your code, later we will discuss how to turn this kind of thing on and off, but you can always comment out your helper-print statements if you want things to run with less verbiage.
4. Not knowing what is next is normal, not knowing where to begin is normal: starting is more important than being correct. Writing a plan (see 1-3), whether on paper or in an IDE/text editor will help you find your footing but also allow you to ask for help more effectively, "I dont' get it" is not a valid sentence if you are asking for help in life, but "I am stuck on this part of the plan because I don't understand how to do X" shows the person you are asking that you are trying to point them in the right direction. This applies as much to teachers as colleagues, friends, etc. The more you show that you have tried breaking down the problem, the more someone trying to help will be able to zero in on where the gap is. 
5. Everyone uses documentation, learning how documentation works is part of learning how to code and how to solve coding challenges: not remembering something is to be expected, not knowing how to find something just isn't necessary anymore. If you need any other resources or just find the ones you were using to be unsatisfactory in some way, ask around (but maybe don't just blindly search on the web, as you are likely not going to get stuff tailored to your situation). Using documentation to figure out what methods and functions exist and how to use them is what the beginning middle and end of learning to code looks like, just the documentation and the challenges you try to solve get more involved and complex.
6. If there is a brief, complete the minimum required for the brief first, then start expanding and creating more elaborate stuff: it can be too easy to get lost in the part of the project you enjoy and want to dive deep into that one forgets the rest of an assignment. In other contexts, doing the minimum can feel like one is doing enough: in the case of coding, the minimum requirements are usually enough, all that is above that is to be encouraged, but is then about your learning, not fulfilling an assignment.

I am sure there will be more of these as the semester goes on, thanks for helping me learn to be better able to help you all learn! :) JSA


Learning Python

The following are a list of tutorials (contained in Jupyter Notebooks) that I created for learning python that have a focus on Machine Learning, an area that often has a lot of built in “mysticism” these days. On the one hand, these are just a way of learning the basics of python, on the other hand, they are a bit different from other tutorials you might see online. For example, you will notice that there is an invitation to complete these tutorials in any order: while it is true that some of the content is cumulative (builds upon previous lessons) in my experience, a good problem is a better motivator than “the next thing”... so my first recommendation is to spend a few minutes scanning all of the tutorials, if you find an example interesting in a latter tutorial, start with that one and see if you can fill in the necessary material on the fly—you would be surprised how much faster you learn when you go from interesting problem to interesting problem!

what experience do you have with teaching computer science: 




most of my experience teaching computer science comes from two sources, managing instructors, and teaching mathematics through programming. the first case involved woking with 4 fantastic instructors at Youth Employment Services in Toronto, Over the course of my time there we worked to completely revamp the programs structure: especially in the case of our AWS certification course we focused on a portfolio approach, so that learners had more than just a badge at the end of it, they also had a series of projects that not only demonstrated what they had learned (beyond the initial course parameters) but these served as evidence to employers to show that they were able to do more than answer multiple choice or fill in the blank questions. In the end, we found that those who had completed the portfolio were more than twice as likely to get employed, which was our key metric.

In the latter case, in both South LA and Berlin I use programming as a way of helping high school students  gain proficiency in mathematics. While I was relatively new to teaching at the time, my initial forays into computer science were often through the lens of mathematics, as that was the field I was in when I first developed an interest in programming. If you want someone to understand a concept, almost any concept, but technical ones are the most directly translatable, have them code it up! With python offering such low barrier for entry I found myself encouraging the use of google collab and jupyter notebooks to get the time between idea and implementation to be a short as possible. Most students started out skeptical, feeling that these subjects were entirely disparate, but by the end I had a good dozen students able to not only program with full control flow, Object oriented programming, and recursion

As my students come from diverse backgrounds, with equally diverse expectations, a few assumptions and questions kept coming up regarding testing, exams, assessment, and grading.


To that end, let us briefly go through what assessment is for: the educational models of the day distinguish between two (broadly speaking) types of assessment, formative and summative. This distinction focuses on the difference between assessments during the learning process and as a conclusion to a topic. In our classes we will have what is sometimes (unfortunately) called continuous assessment. This means that each week you will have a few different things to do: a reflection, a set of problems to complete, and a set of problems to generate (create, or literally make up) on your own. The latter two will comprise your assessment for a given section.
