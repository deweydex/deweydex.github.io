        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Introduction — Learning Happens in Your Head</h2>
            <p>Let me start by saying what this text is not: this is not a list of rules. Ours is a classroom where we each, as individuals, learn various things together. Most of the learning will not happen in this classroom, but rather on your own time, whether at home, your favorite coffee shop, pub, or library. Studying can certainly happen in groups, and group assignments will almost certainly arise over the course of our time together, but the learning can only happen in your head. You can only demonstrate that learning through effort spent in working on assignments, assessments, projects, reflections, and other products. Can some of those sessions be done in groups—absolutely! I just want to emphasize that the actual learning, and the evidence of that learning in what you produce, happens by connecting exactly one brain to the keyboard. With that out of the way, let's jump right into some administrivia!</p>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <h3>Short Version: Mutual Respect + Communication + Self-Honesty</h3>
                <p>You are welcome to read the words below, or refer to the <a href="faqs.html">FAQs section</a>, but the general way that I conduct my classes is less about rules and more about norms and equitable treatment.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Ours is a group made up of (young) adults, meaning that everyone is in my class because they seek to achieve a certain goal. What that goal is likely depends (at least somewhat) on the individual, though it is likely partially dictated by the educational and economic structure in which we find ourselves.</p>

            <p>I genuinely want you, and every student in our class, to succeed. That success needs to take into account where each learner starts and how far they have progressed. With this in mind, my assessments tend to either use online resources or are project based. Both require you to demonstrate mastery of certain competencies, but both do not involve terminal grades after one attempt, but rather a variety of opportunities for improvement. As in all things, the more effort you put in, the more you engage with the material and methods in this course, and the more you demonstrate that effort and engagement through participation, submission of assignments, and reflections, the more easily I can see what you have learned, the more easily I can intuit where you might need some extra assistance or resources, and the more time and flexibility I will be willing to give you.</p>

            <p>As this is a classroom of adults, it is my assumption that you are able to either articulate or simply act upon your needs: You do not need to ask permission to use the washroom, drink water, eat food, take a call (outside of the classroom), take a five minute break or request one for the group, etc. Since we will often be surrounded by computers, this involves some common sense changes to behavior (open beverages are to be handled with caution, oily food near keyboards doesn't respect that device's next user, and so on). Overall, this is a space where we are all here to learn, that means accommodating each other's learning styles, educational background, propensities and difficulties, successes and struggles.</p>

            <p>Communication is a two way street, I will do my best to be both clear and concise (that last one is far harder for me) in my communications with you, so that you can know what to expect, what changes arise, and what to look out for. For more about communication see below!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Attendance and Punctuality</h2>
            <p>It is assumed that you attend every class, from start to finish and attendance will be taken. This is especially important for those who receive welfare or are part of certain governmental programs. For the first portion of nearly every class we will engage in intention setting and planning, for the last portion of nearly every class we will engage in reflection, if you are late, or must leave early, please let me know the reason via email or message and submit your planning or reflection as usual within 48 hours. If you know that you will be late or must leave early, please send me a message with a brief explanation as soon as you are aware of the delay.</p>

            <p>Should lateness or leaving early prove to be a pattern, please expect me to reach out so that we can have a conversation: the goal is to aid in your learning, not to punish or chastise you. If you are struggling generally to meet other expectations of the course, let us figure out some ways that your learning can best be supported.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Illness and Other Absences</h2>
            <p>If there are any unforeseen absences, for example you are sick or had to handle a personal emergency just go ahead and let me know via email/message. If a pattern emerges or you will be out for a significant amount of time (or have some kind of scheduling conflict), the general advice is the same: just let me know, let's talk about it and we will work something out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Make Up Classes</h2>
            <p>If I am absent for more than one class we will work on what makeup work looks like to potentially cover material that we missed. We will work together to figure out a format and schedule that works for the most people—if we have to split the class in two, we will make that work (the time is on me, after all, not on you all). If there is a need for a substitute you will be informed as soon as I know the situation!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Communication and Professionalism</h2>
            <p>In general we will use Moodle as well as email for communication about our work together. Handouts will appear on Moodle but can also be found here (and should be sent to your email once settings have been so configured). The following are some general ideas about communication as well as specific norms that will help us to communicate better, both between teacher and student and amongst yourselves as students.</p>

            <p>How we communicate in a given context depends on lots of factors big and small: everything from our age, mother-tongue, dialect, upbringing, culture and prior educational and professional experiences shape how we speak and write to each other. Today, sometimes it can be difficult to understand how to address people in different circumstances. During my courses I try to include a day where we discuss communication, but I can give a brief overview of expectations here. The general idea is to think of all communications we share as taking place within a professional context.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>When we write to each other (and when we speak to each other), no matter what medium (email, chat, code comment, etc.) we should use full sentences whenever possible and avoid using words that refer to other words or ideas like "that, it, thing" or even "the assignment" or "the question" when the other person might not super clear what particular "thing" is being referenced.</li>
                <li>In written communication we will use capitalization (especially of words like I and proper nouns) and be as grammatical as possible (sometimes, when discussing math and computer science terms, grammar can be confusing!). If you need any advice or help with your writing, there are lots of great tools online (Grammarly for example) and there are plenty of folks who can help around, just ask!</li>
                <li>We want to explain answers to problems and questions, no matter the subject; this means more than showing your work, it also means "teaching to the page" which we will discuss more in class, and in an upcoming handout.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Submissions</h2>
            <p>To be determined based on platform constraints: short answer, on Moodle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Notes and Note Taking</h2>
            <p>In many classes there are those who worry that if they do not take notes they will miss a key piece of information or not know how to study properly. In my class you can expect me to be fully transparent about my policies, assignments, assessments, and projects as well as why and how I made the decisions that shaped them. One of my main goals is that you, as a student, become more aware of both how you learn and how to find and evaluate the information you need. Sometimes this means abandoning old habits, or creating new ones: while note-taking is certainly allowed in my class, you should know that it is not necessary.</p>

            <p>The information in my courses exist "out there," none of it is new, none of it is particularly difficult to find. I will of course provide recommendations and resources, as well as handouts and assignments that I have created to supplement and support your learning. But "missing something" is not a possibility in my courses: if you learn the material of the module (which will be posted publicly and repeatedly), how you learned it is less important than the fact that you learned it. There are so many ways of getting excited about and engaging with the stuff we are learning together, I will do my best to provide you with multiple resources with differing looks, feels, and media. All this is to say, notes are welcome, but not necessary. While it can be difficult, try to remember that we are in class to learn stuff and have fun doing so!</p>
